"1","Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Wipes Refill 350ct.","I use these wipes because my daughter was reacting badly to commercial wipes. She tolerates these so I will continue to use them but they are very thin and not nearly moist enough to get all the poop off without using many more wipes. I hope to find an alternative.",NA
"2","Bugaboo Frog Complete Stroller","yes, this product is sooo expensive. but it\'s worth every penny. it\'s very versatile (i can always keep my baby out of the sun by flipping the handle), easy to put together and take in and out of your car trunk, very comfortable for the baby, fits your baby from birth till a long while later, has tons of useful and cute accessories, and has great resale value.  worth every single penny.",5

"4","BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector","This seat protector works well. I just wish there was a way to hook the top part (the vertical piece) onto a back seat that doesn\'t have a head rest. We had to just fold that vertical part. I can see a baby who is older and can kick the seat getting the back of the seat all dirty unless the vertical part is hooked up.",NA
"5","Safety 1st Prograde Cabinet Lock","This is one of the few child safety devices I purchased that actually works well.  Installs easily.  Easy to open for an adult, impossible for baby.  Keeps our bathroom and kitchen cabinets safe from your little ones.  Highly recommended.  Only works on double door front cabinets.",5
"6","ProCase 2013 version ASUS MeMO Pad 8 ME180A Protective Case with bonus stylus pen - Tri-Fold Leather Cover Case exclusive for 2013 ASUS MeMO Pad 8 ME180A Tablet, Built-in Stand (Yellow)","Like it because it isn\'t too bulky, does the job. Auto sleeps tablet when closed, fits well. &#34; Leather&#34; is stiff and flat - slightly better than cardboard, but nicer than plastic. I picked yellow because I\'m sick of dark colors - can\'t find your stuff in the common tote, briefcase or purse because they tend to all be lined with black fabric. Only colors for me now - there are lots of bright ones to choose from with this case - white was not among them, so if you\'re looking for sophistication, you\'re stuck with black.",4

"9","Arms Reach Co-Sleeper brand Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural","Mine does NOT turn into a play yard, I don\'t understand why they don\'t advertise or inform us correctly, I loved this product until my daughter started pulling herself up to standing with the sides at five months, I went to lower the mattress and to my surprise it is sewn in one position and impossible to lower.... Maybe you can cut it but I didn\'t wanna risk ruining it... I had to go purchase one that did yesterday and sure wish it was the item I originally Baught it\'s great and totally a fair price (graco travel light portable crib)",3

"11","VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor","To put it bluntly- I hate this monitor and can\'t wait to be rid of it. We received the Vtech Safe and Sound monitor as a baby shower gift. During the three months the monitor actually worked, one big problem was that the sound would inexplicably cut out for a minute or two at a time. This wasn\'t a huge deal. What was a huge deal was when the receivers simply stopped linking with the monitor after only three months of use. We called Vtech and they admitted that we had received a faulty product. They offered to replace it for free, however, we had to pay the $40 shipping charges. We just got our new monitor and plugged it in for the first time. EXACT SAME PROBLEM. I suppose I should be grateful for the three months use I got out of the old monitor, as I won\'t get a single night\'s use out of this one. I am hugely disappointed with Vtech and plan to NEVER buy one of their products again. I will NOT be replacing this monitor with another Vtech headache.Buyer beware!!!",NA
"12","HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Do not look at the weight ranges when deciding on a size.  My son is at the top end of the size large weight range, but this item will still fit him for many months.  Instead, look at the height ranges for a more accurate size determination.  My tall son is growing out of size 18-24 month clothing, but the size large sleepsack (size 12-18 months) will fit him for many more months.",5
"13","Fisher Price Newborn Rock \'n Play Sleeper - Split Rings","My son would not sleep anywhere else except right next to me in our bed.  We tried a cradle, bassonette, his crib, and anywhere else we could think of, but he would sleep for maybe 20 minutes after we put him down or an hour at the absolute most and then wake up.  We bought this when he was almost 3 months old and kept the receipt so if it didn\'t work we could take it back, but the very first night we had it he slept 6 hours straight in it!  It was a life saver, and now he is 4 months old and he sleeps in it every night for anywhere from 5-8 hours before he wakes up!",5
"14","Harmony Kids Round Back Glider, Blue Chenille","We ordered this chair before my daughter was born and have had it for almost four months now.  We looked at comparable chairs that were hundreds of dollars more expensive and decided to go with this one based on the great reviews.  The chair is very comfortable and sturdy.  We decided to purchase the matching ottoman as well, and I\'m glad we did.  We have spent many nights rocking our little one back to sleep in this chair.  Highly reccomend this chair for your nursery!",5

"17","Baby Einstein Activity Gym","My neice who\'s a sharp as a tac navy pilot had a baby this summer and when I asked her for advice on what to buy for a baby shower she said that this was the best item!

They started using it when their baby was only a week old and say he loves it and that it never fails to stop him from crying.",5
"18","Summer Infant Sure &amp; Secure Walk-Thru Gate","I bought this gate because it was the only one I could find that fit at the bottom of the stairs at my house....big mistake. It was not too difficult to set up, although they could have made the process simpler, but OMG... it was impossible to open once installed.They advertise that you can open it with one hand, but people who can do that must be magicians. I could not open this gate even using both hands.Needless to say, it is going back to BabiesRUs and now I have to search for another gate that will fit my 39 inch opening at the bottom of the stairs.",NA

I have to say that they really do a great job at swaddling a newborn/infant and keeping him swaddled the entire night. My son loves it and already knows that as soon as his swaddle is on, it is &#34;night-night&#34; time. The only negative or downfall that I have found is that the swaddle gets very stretched out after a few weeks of daily use and needs to be completly replaced if continuing to swaddle.",5
"22","Bob Stroller Handlebar Console with Tire Pump, Single","The console part works great...worth buying it just for that, the pump on the other hand is a pain. I actually went and bought a different one that fits.",4
"23","Babymel Big Slouchy Diaper Bag,Twisted Khaki,One Size","I love this bag.  It is stylish and functional.  It has useful pockets inside for keeping all your bits and pieces, such as cream and bottles.  It comes with a cooler bag where you can keep one bottle (maybe two at a squeeze).  It also includes a matching changing mat, which is really handy.  It has a side pocket with a velcro enclosure.  It is large enough to hold a few disposable nappies, a change of clothes, a couple of bottles, some a small case of wipes, some barrier cream, a couple of muslin burp cloths, the change mat and still room for more.  It has a nice finish which you can wipe clean with a cloth.  If you love a good handbag, you\'ll appreciate the quality and functionality of this piece... why should you lose style when you have a baby?  Highly recommended.",5
"24","SwaddleDesigns zzZipMe Sack with 2-Way Zipper, Cotton Flannel Wearable Blanket, Angry Birds Baby, Yellow Bird 3- 6 Months","This sack is just too cute to resist - especially for anyone who loves the Angry Birds games.  I love Swaddle Designs products and this looks like a winner - the babies are still too young for me to say how the size will be in a few months, but it certainly looks as it it will be in use for a long time.",5
"25","Sunshine Kids Seat Belt Pillow, Grey","This is just as described.  My 6 year old uses it and says it\'s &#34;fine&#34;.  I think it would work for adult passengers who wish to take a nap.  It functions just fine for my 6 year old, but I sort of wish I had held out and bought him one of the character belt pillows with a little more personality.  It works for him, but he wasn\'t particularly excited about it.  It is a good value for the cost and much cheaper than a character pillow.",4
"26","The Shower Hug for Pregnant and Nursing Moms., X/S, White with Petal Pink Trim","The shower hug is a very luxurious product, especially while being sore from nursing.

"27","Neat Solutions Dora the Explorer Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 10-Count","Comes in handy. My wife keeps a pack of these whenever we are leaving home just in case the kids have to use the bath room even at McDonald or any 3+ star hotel",5
"28","Fisher-Price Deluxe Newborn Rock N Play Sleeper, My Little Sweetie","We have this as well as the (absurdly expensive) MamaRoo, and my six-week-old vastly prefers this.He would spend 24 hours a day in his Rock n\' Play if I let him. He naps in it and is perfectly happy lounging in it awake during the day.I put him in a bassinet at night in hopes of making the transition to a crib easier, but honestly, when he\'s having a rough night, I\'ll sometimes let him sleep in the Rock n\' Play because it\'s pretty much magic. We also use this as a travel sleeper because it folds up so easily.I don\'t have the vibrating version, but I don\'t miss it. If you put the Rock n\' Play on a hard floor, he can rock himself by wiggling around. Otherwise, it\'s easy to nudge and get it rocking.LOVE this thing.",5
"29","Graco Travel Lite Table Chair Tango in the Tongo","This chair works great for us. We have a small dining room and a conventional high chair would not fit. So I ordered a Graco Travel Lite Table Chair. It fits perfectly in our space and our son loves it. It\'s a little tough to get him in and out, but that\'s not a big problem. It\'s also great because when we visit relatives we just take his high chair with us since most people don\'t have spare high chairs lying around. I definitely recommend this product for both daily use and travel.",NA
"30","Storksak Elizabeth Leather Diaper Bag -Tan","Quality is prime, love the smell of leather.  Got many compliments on it.  I don\'t like all the graphics of flowers and prints so this simple but yet elegant bag fits me.  This is a quality bag that will last for years and years and I can turn it into a personal bag for myself after my baby is older.  That saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; and this fit\'s that perfectly.  Lots of pockets inside for everything.  If you\'re a super big packer, this bag might not be for you.  It\'s a medium size bag and you can\'t stretch it too much.  There\'s a youtube video review where the girl is showing how much you can put inside the bag.  I\'m very happy with my purchase :)",NA
"31","Baby Trend Velocity Jogging Stroller - Cobblestone","This stroller is AWESOME! Despite many negative reviews, I went with my gut and purchased this stroller and am SO GLAD that I did. A 3 wheel stroller is necessary for walking my son in my neighborhood which has uneven sidewalks and hilly terrain. I only jog around a track, I wouldn\'t jog with this on sidewalks as it doesn\'t have much shock absorption. The seat lays back, almost flat and the sun visor adjusts - its PERFECT! So easy to put together and easily folds up. It does stand on its own when folded but does take up a considerable amount of space. I drive a crossover and there is plenty of room in the back to transport it. My only real concern is aside from not being able to figure out how to get the pedometer to work, the tray is VERY difficult to lift and put back into place. Unlike my old baby trend stroller there is no button to release the tray lock it has a very cheap red tab that locks it into place.",5

"33","Kissa\'s Newborn All-In-One Diaper, Green","I was really excited to use these diapers.  I put them on my baby registry and was thrilled to see that someone had bought them for me.  Once we were home from the hospital, I immediately put my little girl into a beautiful blue diaper!  It was adorable.  However, I think we may not have dried them long enough after the first few wash/dry cycles to prep them because out LO broke out in a yeast infection after about 3 days of wearing.  This, of course, caused us to have to strip and ""de-yeast"" our brand new diapers.  (no fault of the diapers themselves, just frustrating!)  Anyway, after that challenge, we were happily using the diapers for about 3 weeks.  Then, we noticed that our LO started to soak through the diapers at night.  She would wake up for middle of the night feedings and have to be completely changed because her clothes were soaked!  I was surprised that a 4 week old could soak through the diaper, but it happened nearly every night until we started using our hemp wipes as ""inserts.""  That solved the problem for a few days, but it wasn\'t a long-term fix.  Around week 5 we decided to give our pocket diapers (initially too big to fit) a try.  And thankfully they fit.  We\'ve switched to the pocket diapers and are much happier with the result.Bottom line:  The sizing is great for newborns.  The snap down for the cord is a great idea.  We found the absorbency to be an issue for our little one around 4 weeks old.  She could have fit into these diapers for another 4 weeks, but there is no way we could have contained her pee for that much longer without a doubler or some other soaker insert!These diapers are not worth $15/diaper for the length of time that they are usable.  I don\'t recommend these diapers.  I wish we would have saved our money and just used prefolds and inexpensive newborn covers for this stage. (or even, dare I say, disposables!!)  :)",2
"34","The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","This stroller is lightweight and really easy to expand/collapse even when holding a squirming kid. It\'s comfortable and the compartment underneath is just big enough to fit a few essentials and the \'tray\' up top is also very handy and the right size for keys/phone/water bottle, etc.  It\'s also pretty sturdy and doesn\'t look like the cheapy strollers you see for $10 or whatever.  Overall I\'m pleased with it.  We bought it to take on vacation with us and it held up well and took a beating.  I have 2 cons - 1) the canopy is completely useless, but we\'ve solved that by using a hat instead; and 2) the handles are just a little low and close, I\'m 5\'6 and have to hunch just slightly when pushing it and they\'re also just a little to close to the stroller (meaning I occasionally kick the tires with my foot when walking).  Those issues are pretty minor and overall I\'m very pleased with it.  I have another larger, more expensive stroller that doesn\'t have those issues, but it\'s a project getting that thing in and out of a car or up/down stairs.  I find myself preferring this stroller and never even use the other one anymore.",4
"35","BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red","This was my second purchase of a BabyBjorn potty chair.  I had bought my daughter one when she began potty training my 2 year old grandson, but not one for my home.  I was using a potty insert and a stool and found little Ben was having trouble getting on.  I asked how the BabyBjorn was working and she told me he uses it only.  She was so right, I am so happy to have purchased this; mine is blue and her\'s is red.  He loves it; it is sturdy, easy to clean, and does not move when he sits down or gets up.Wonderful item and I highly recommend for the daunting task of potty training!  I plan on this being my number #1 baby shower gift from now on!",5

"37","Munchkin Mighty Grip Flip Straw Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","My two 11 month olds have been using this cup for just over a month.  They seem to drink a lot more water with these cups as opposed to the regular sippy cups...no need to tip the cup back when you have a straw!It really does seem spill proof.  I use a strap (Sippigrip) to keep the cup from hitting the floor when in the high chair and stroller...and many times the cup is hanging upside down - and it doesn\'t leak.I also love how you can flip the straw down to keep it from getting dirty.  It makes it real easy to stick this cup in my purse to run an errand and not worry about the straw getting yucky.Cleaning/Assembly: Is pretty easy.  The directions are very good and shows you how to take apart the little flippy part on the lid.The part of the straw the kids suck on is soft...and my kids love to chew on it when not sucking on it...but the straw holds up just fine.I also bought a pair of ""Luv N\' Care Nuby 12 oz Mega Sipper"" and *I* like these (Munchkin) cups better from a leak and assembly point of view...although I think my kids may drink slightly better from the other (Nuby) cups.  The Nuby cups are BPA-free, I\'m not sure about these cups.The first time you use these, the parent/adult should suck on the straw first to make sure it is opened up.  Check the directions too - I\'m pretty sure I saw tips to make sure the straw is opened...otherwise your kid will get frustrated when they can\'t get the liquid to come up!I recommend these cups - I would buy another pair if I needed to!",5
"38","Mamas &amp; Papas Tour Stroller - Purple","Mamas and Papas is a high end brand. This umbrella stroller does not really live upto that standard. I have an iCOO stroller which I like a little more than this stroller. The biggest dislikes are that the incline function on this stroller is ridiculous... its a strap that you move up and down and it wont stay in place. There are no real incline positions. The next not great thing is that the under carriage is soo small. You can barely fit a regular hand bag in there. And you cannot access the carriage unless the child gets off. The best features of this stroller are the color and the strap to carry it when closed.",3

"40","Lamaze Peek-A-Boo Puppy Cloth Book","I saw the one-star review of this book and HAD to write my own.  Here\'s why.  I have several of the Lamaze cloth books.  Some have words, some don\'t.  My 6-month-old LOVES these books!  She isn\'t at all patient with the board books, but there\'s something about these cloth books that make her sit perfectly and listen to the whole story - that Mommy makes up.  For some reason when I try to ""read"" a book with words, she gets a little bored.  But when I make up stories for Mittens the Kitten and Peek-a-Boo Puppy she sits captivated and listens.  These books, I don\'t know what it is about them but they deserve 5 stars for not only being made with baby-safe products but also getting my daughter\'s attention when other books don\'t.  I highly recommend these books.",5
"41","DK Leigh Owl 10 Piece Gender Neutral Crib Bedding Set, Yellow/Green","This is a very nice Bedding Set and the embroider owls are adorable . I received it in the mail yesterday and I am very happy with it. It does looks better in person since the colors are a bit more subtle . Although it\'s colorful it doesn\'t interfere with the neutrality in the baby nursery. I would definitely recommend this to a friend",NA
"42","Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","I use the snuffler at home in baby\'s chair and I had to buy a second one to put in his carseat. He loves it so much. He doesn\'t like sitting in his seat when the snuzzler\'s in the wash and he has to wait on it. I take it out of the dryer and put him in it and he just falls fast asleep. It makes him feel like I\'m hugging him. I highly recommend it!",5

"44","Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer, Blue","I thought about getting an Itzbeen with my first, but opted not to.  There were so many other expenses, and really, I could use paper and pen.  With the birth of our second (and our first only 17months) I knew I was going to need something else.  This thing has been awesome! I highly recommend it.  My favorite part is the alarm that you can set for each function.  This is particularly helpful with feedings.  With my 1st child, we had to reset an alarm each time in the evening, which was one more thing keeping us from going back to sleep.  This is automatic so I never have to think about it.  I don\'t know how I would keep track of all this without this handy dandy device.Other favorites? Sturdy belt clip, small and light weight so it\'s easy to drag around with me, backlight, ""extra"" timer for anything (I\'ve been using it for my medication).So why not 5 stars?  I left off a star because there\'s one thing that would make this perfect.  A counter option.  For me, I would use it to count diapers.  That\'s the only thing that I still have to use paper for these days.  This thing would be perfect with that option.  Until then, practically perfect will have to do!",4

"53","lillebaby COMPLETE Original (Purple/Pink)","I might be the only mom I know who doesn\'t like the Ergo. It felt bulky to me and the snap behind the head was a hassle. I wanted a carrier I could use with my 2 month old with no clumsy infant insert, and also one that would face forward if I wanted.So, I was pleased to see this new carrier. I\'ve only owned it a week, so I will update this review as needed. My first impressions:1.) Not sure why the product description says purple/pink. There\'s no pink on this thing. It\'s purple. Nice color, though.2.) I hope I am wrong about this, but I think some of the Lillebaby customer reviews are suspect. When someone reviews five different Lillebaby carriers and gives them all glowing 5 star reviews, and has no other product reviews associated with their profile, that makes me think you maybe work for Lillebaby. Again, I have no way of proving that they\'ve posted fake customer reviews, but it did make me a little suspicious. That doesn\'t mean it\'s not a good product, it just might mean their marketing is kinda shady.3.) The carrier arrived with a ""lumbar support"" piece but there\'s no mention of how to use it in the instruction manual. I emailed the company about this and they responded right away, with a PDF of their revised instruction manual--which still does not explain how to use the lumbar support.My 2 month old seems to like it, so I am hopeful that we\'ll get lots of use out of it.",NA

(they are now in my rag bag)  At the time, they were the ONLY pre-folded diapers available in the store.After reading other reviews, I purchased  these flannel pre-folded diapers and they are INCREDIBLY soft!

"69","Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Elephant","I love this night light so far. Was skeptical about it because it was not what I was looking for initially and it looked strange with the online photos. The elephant comes off the blue charging stand and turns on automatically. Each color lights the room differently so if I want enough light to feed the baby I can use green. If I want less light while he is sleeping red works too. I\'m sure when he\'s older he will pick his own colors, but doesn\'t matter at 2 months!Light never gets hot and actually lasts a really long time without needing to charge. Easy to carry around the house if I have to walk with the baby too.",5

Cannot imagine using higher level.)It\'s a bit bulky and cannot move it from one spot to another spot easily - I have not tried to fold it.The canopy does nothing, only for decoration.",4
"80","Badger Basket Three Bin Storage Cubby, Blue","We ordered this piece with the additional piece that can be stacked on top.  First, the quality for the price is amazing.  This piece was a cinch to piece together and went together well.  Packaging was good; there were no scratches, dents or dings on this piece at all.There are two cons: The smell is pretty strong.  I almost wonder if it\'s not formaldahyde or something similar in the wood.  It\'s very strong and hasn\'t dissipated in the four days it\'s been in our living room.  The second con is that the instructions say that hardware is included to bracket two pieces together.  This is true--the caveat is that apparently they are expecting you to stack two of the same pieces together.  We purchased the bookcase-type piece to stack on top and each of the pieces came with brackets to connect the same piece. There were no cross-style brackets.All in all, I am happy (wish the smell wasn\'t a factor).  The three bins took the place of three fabric bins AND two large plastic tubs that were full of toys.  My 17 month old clapped and laughed when he saw what daddy had built for him.",4

However, since he started eating solid foods, and having messier diapers to change, we\'ve starting using these a lot. It makes clean up so much easier! Also, they can be washed if they are just wet.

"90","North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","I happily ordered a second system for my in-laws home.I cannot stress enough that if you buy ANY play-yard for the purpose of leaving your child unattended, then you are going to have issues of some sort.We purchased this initially because our 13 month old had simply outgrown the pack-n-play as a play area.  He needed the room to move around, whether crawling, standing, or even attempting to walk.  However, what he didn\'t need was to get into things, pull items off tables or chew on wires.  And that\'s with me sitting right there.I have the base package and it\'s set up in the hexagon shape with no problems.  We are not constantly opening and closing the system, nor would I want to.  I don\'t want to weaken the joints or closures. So, I simply lift my 25-lb child up and over.We sit in the yard with our child, rolling the ball back and forth, he can stand up or crawl around safely.",5

When we found out we were having twins, we needed another pail for their nursery since the first child is still in diapers.  I saw the Elite, and thought it would be just like the original II, but with the step pedal, a little easier to operate.  We have been using this for two months now and have moved it to the garage since we can\'t stand how it doesn\'t keep the smell out.  Every time it is opened, you get a whiff that lingers for some time.  With the number if diapers we are changing, it is too much.

"94","Safety 1st Magnetic Locking System","I installed the previous version (Tot Loks) at my old house. LOVED them. Went to buy more (for a new house) and saw these. I love these even more. Installation was MUCH, MUCH, MUCH easier. The locks seem to open easier (with the key). By this I mean that it seems that I don\'t need to be as precise with the key placement in order to get the doors to open. They are more ""plasticky"" than the Tot Loks, and I was concerned that they might break. But, that hasn\'t been a problem.Pros: Totally hidden locks. Easy to use. Can disengage (and re-engage) instantly and easily. Extremely safe. Very much improved installation (vs previous version)Cons: Have to be installed. Potential to damage cabinets during installation (if not careful).I\'m still firmly in the baby years, but I actually love these beyond babyproofing. I love being able to lock bathroom cabinets when guests are over (to avoid an busy-bodies rumaging through my stuff).If I didn\'t already have TONS of spare magnentic keys from my Tot Lok sets, I\'d recommend buying the smaller sets. That way you end up with more keys. More keys = better. You\'re bound to misplace them (or lock them inside the cabinets) from time to time. It\'s nice to have a key in each bathroom and a few in the kitchen.",5

The tray broke (locking clip on left side broke off) and now my 1 year old can easily pop off the tray with one kick of his leg.  The tray itself is not adjustable so  as he gets bigger he will outgrow it.  The booster is not as compact as I thought, so I don\'t really know how much better of a traveling seat it is than others.  So next time....I will check the reviews first!  Lesson learned.",1

Now, he eats from it without a thought. You do need a game plan when applying it to a surface. I start with the edge closest to the kid, then the sides, then the farthest edge. It minimizes the kid\'s ability to grab it and play with it while you\'re wrestling with it.Another positive side effect is that the kid\'s mess is mostly contained and you just wrap it up to be thrown away, leaving minimal mess for the wait staff to deal with.",5

"106","Joovy Caboose Too Rear Seat, Greenie","I loved that the joovy caboose tandem had the option to add this extra seat. It is a great idea! The seat is lightweight and though it takes a few steps to put on and take off, it\'s doable. It could easily be stored away in a bag on a trip and is pretty comfortable. I, however, ended up returning it along with the stroller because the seat backs were too short for my kids (2 1/2 yr old and 9 month old). My kids are both in the 90+ percentile range for height and have long torsos on top of that. My 9 month is so tall the seat back was not tall enough reach above her head, if that makes sense (her head is above the seat by a couple of inches). This was a problem for me because I wanted my kids to be able to nap on long days out, especially my 9 month old. I would give this 5 stars if the seat backs were a few inches taller and/or their was a built-in canopy to go along with it. It could definitely use a canopy. If only I could help with the design. I really loved the idea of this and wanted to love it!!",3

"110","Peg Perego Aria Twin MT Stroller 2005","Like another reviewer, we REALLY wanted to love this stroller.  We have a Maclaren single stroller and had strongly considered the double, but bought the Peg Perego Twin Aria because it was significantly lighter and had a single handlebar to steer and a single basket.  I am regretting it now!Our problems with the Aria (not in any order of importance; I\'m too sleep-deprived to do that right now!):1) The Aria stickers came off after about a week\'s worth of use.2) The handling is, in my husband\'s words, ""squishy"".  We have a 25-month-old and a 3-month old and the weight difference between them makes this challenging to push...because the plastic parts on the stroller have a LOT of give.3) It\'s REALLY hard to push around the neighborhood over bumps, holes and big cracks in the sidewalk (we live in Chicago).  Just too much give in the steering.4) The basket DOES drag on the ground (I admit that we overload it, but we use this around town and put a lot of stuff in it).5) It\'s very easy to open and close, as long as you use both hands (if you are holding a baby and trying to do it, it\'s much harder).  If you have garage space and don\'t need to open and close it all the time, this will benefit you!!Okay, the good:1) Love the look.2) Love the deep seats (and both recline).3) Love the food trays (and the option to NOT use them).4) Love that it stands up on its own when folded!  Genius.I just expected much more stability for the price.  If you are NOT hard on strollers and don\'t have to fold/unfold it all the time, you\'ll probably really like this stroller.

I was very concerned about comfort and security, and the weePOD provides both (nice mechanism for making sure the seat doesn\'t shift around), but every time, and I mean every single time my son pees, it runs down the really good high splash guard and gets up under the weePod and gets all over the toilet seat. I know that toilet training a 2yo boy isn\'t ever going to be neat and tidy, but to have the training seat itself cause the problem is just a bit much. It really makes the comfort and security irrelevant. I\'m now back to square one in terms of seeking a good training potty seat, and it won\'t be a Prince Lionheart.",2

I wanted to love this seat since we hardly ever use the 2nd car and it is economical (cheaper on the walmart.com website) but not until he is older and bigger.  I think it says 5 lbs and up, but I would NOT place a newborn in this seat!",2
"125","Safety 1st Vantage High Back Booster Car Seat, Nitron","Purchased this as a 2nd seat as my 2 year old daughter will be heading to ""school"" and we needed another seat for dropoff & pickup.  I have installed many car seats in the past but nothing like this...  Purchased based on reviews & Consumer Reports.Seat is light and durable looking.  Fabric does look like it may snag easily though.  Cupholder and kid accessible storage is a bonus.Installation was almost impossible on my 2003 Subaru Forester:1)  tried LATCH - I could not pull it tight enough to secure the seat so that it would not move.  Upon further examination I found that the tightening side of the LATCH strap had run out of room.  There is a strap which attaches the LATCH strap to the seat preventing me from pulling any tighter.  Very disappointed that the LATCH did not work.2)  tried the shoulder/lap belt install - I was able to get it tight, had to use the locking clip on the seatbelt but it was almost impossible to get the locking clip on because the seatbelt buckle (when tight) is behind the seat.After about 1.5hrs of fighting with this seat & a steady stream of profanity, it was in but I am not convinced it\'s as secure as our Britax Boulevard or PegPerego infant seat that were a snap to install via LATCH.Summary:1)  The one strap LATCH system on this seat is awful2)  Does not work well in a 2003 Subaru Forester3)  Nice lightweight design4)  Don\'t expect to easily move it between vehicles5)  It\'s your kid\'s safety... pay a few $$ more and get a Britax (which I will likely do and put this one on Craigslist)",2

"135","BUILT NY Munchler Lunch Bag - Meadow","My daughter received the Dog lunch bag to use as a snack bag on her first day of playgroup.  The first time my petite 4 yo tried to unzip her new Dog lunch bag, the zipper broke in half leaving a sharp stub.  She still loves it because it\'s so cute, so I covered the sharp part with electrical tape.  Now, after having used this for almost a year, the corners are starting to crack.  As much as this product costs, it should be made with materials strong enough to withstand a 4yo\'s tiny fingers.  I wish I had gotten a bento box instead.If you\'re still thinking of buying this, the dog size can hold a half sandwich, an orange or apple and a yogurt, no problem.  If you need to pack a full lunch for an older child including a drink, it\'ll be a tight squeeze, if possible at all.",NA

"137","Fisher-Price Baby Papasan","We purchased our Baby Papasan second hand for about $30.00.  My husband and I were very impressed with the product initially.  The padding is very plush and easy to wash.  We also thought the music was very soothing (didn\'t sound annoying like a lot of other baby products do).Unfortunately, our son didn\'t like the seat as much as his parents did :-)  When he was a newborn (7lbs, 11oz) the seat didn\'t support his head very well.  He hates the music that we found so soothing and pleasant.  Music/vibrations are on a 15 minute timer, so if he does happen to fall asleep, he\'s usually wakes up as soon as the vibrations stop.  He is now 8 weeks old and cries hysterically if we put him in it when he\'s awake.This isn\'t a bad product.  It just wasn\'t a good match for my son.  His sitter has an Ocean Wonders Bouncer that he absolutly loves.  I guess he just prefers something more stimulating.",3
"138","phil&amp;teds Poppy Highchair, Bubblegum","I bought this high chair for my third and last child, so I didn\'t want to spend a fortune. I had previously used a Boon Flair for my two older children. Over the years, the seat became a bit wobbly, so I thought it was time for a new one. I have big kids (90th percentile for height and weight) so I need something strong. My house is overrun by toys so I really didn\'t want a high chair that just screams BABY in my dining room.Here\'s what I did like about the Poppy High Chair:1. Looks: It looks great. It\'s very minimalist. The red is nice cranberry red without being too loud.2. Large tray: It has a nice large tray that goes all the way around and doesn\'t seem to leave any nooks and cranes for food to get trapped.3. Cleaning: The material of the seat comes off easily and it seems like it would be easy to clean. Again, the seat really did try to make as one piece as possible and really doesn\'t leave any nooks and cranies.4. Length of Use: I really liked that it could potentially be used as a toddler/child chair later.Here\'s what I didn\'t like and I think are fatal flaws to the Poppy Chair:1. Durability: I found the whole seat to be a little wobbly. It\'s held up by 4 little thin metal sticks. It has less support than some folding chairs. At least with my kids, I don\'t think it will hold up for several years to even get to the child/toddler seat setting.2. Difficult tray: While I liked the large tray, I did not like that it was very difficult to get the tray off. I actually had to read the manual to make sure I was trying the right thing. Pressing a plastic notch/bottom down. I was trying the right way, but it was just really tricky. This was without a child in there. I can only imagine how difficult it would be to do this day in and day out with a wriggly child. And your child will be wriggly (see next post).3. The decorative harness/straps: I call them decorative because they are not at all functional. It has shoulder straps, but they come from the bottom, not the top of the chair. These shoulder straps are more for decoration or to appease parents to think that their child is in a 5 point harness, but they are not. So when you are fighting to remove the tray from the seat you will also be managing a wriggly non-harnessed child.For me, the the super hard tray removal combined with the non-harnessing on a wobbly pair of metal sticks was a fatal combination to this high chair that could not overcome the very nice look and design of the seat. It\'s going back today. I\'ve contacted Boon about getting new bolts to attempt to re-secure my Boon Flair chair and bought new straps and seat padding for that one to try to make it last a couple more years.It really was a nice try by Phil and Teds, but I can\'t understand how the designers thought through the horrible tray removal and harness. Maybe future year models will improve on this, but for now, I\'d say skip this high chair.",1

"142","Graco Ipo Stroller, Spitfire","I am so glad I found this stroller. Originally, I came across this stroller at a Burlingon Coat Factory but they happened to be out of stock. I got to play with the floor model and noticed that it was lightweight and easy to fold down for storage. I have two older sons who had a full stroller travel system. When I used those bulky strollers, I always had a hard time folding the stroller and getting it in the trunk of my car along with the groceries or shopping bags if I was out and about. This stroller holds the same durability as those big travel systems yet doesn\'t have the bulk that comes along with them. The Graco Ipo stroller is just slightly bigger than an umbrella stroller. The difference is in the build. You have better tires on this stroller that allow for easy maneuvering at stores and in parks. The height on the cheap umbrella strollers also seems to be kind of low which is a pain for my husband because he always seems to have to crouch to push those, not with this stroller... The Graco Ipo stroller is built a little bit taller so it\'s at a perfect height for my 5\'9 husband to push with no problems. I am very happy with my purchase and I\'ve even been stopped by other expectant mothers to ask about where I picked up this great stroller. I think it\'s a great purchase and I definitely recommend it.",5

"145","Tiny Love Gymini Move and Play Activity Gym, Animals","Being a new mother I depend on the reviews of other parents before I purchase a product. Since I have had this my baby has used it every day. He LOVES IT !!! I really think this motivated him to crawl. The bars and toys adjust so they are always really easy to capture their attention. The lights and music have to modes continuous and motion sensor. My baby loves the motion sensor mode , he thinks it is hilarious how he kicks and makes it light it up. The toys are detachable so I can even take them with us like on car trips. They easily attach to the car seat and have been a godsend. My little monster(who is 6 months old )does not fall asleep in the car. I have purchsed links and other toys that hang and the work great with it. I have washed the pad itself 2x a week ( slobber, milk, spitup, ect.)and it is still in great condition like new. The only drawback I would say is how to replace the batteries. I can\'t do it but, I am awful with that kind of stuff so I leave that to the hubby. He by the way says it is easy it just needed his ""touch"". Bottom line if this is available get it !",5

We had tried other walkers at friend\'s house and she was able to walk comfortably on lowest height setting.  But other than that, there is no other complaints.  It is well built and not flimsy looking.  Very sturdy and easy to put together.  One of the features I really appreciate is it\'s ability to fold flat for easy storage.  This is very helpful if you are limited in storage pace.  A life saver!  This is the best walker out there!!!!",4
"149","Gerber Knit Crib Sheet ~ Snug Fitting Soft Jersey Knit","As a soon to be second time mom, there is one thing that I have learned when it comes to crib and bassinet sheets - knit is better!  They are much softer on baby\'s skin, plus, my son used to get a rash where his skin pressed up against &quot;regular&quot; sheets.  Anything spilled (or drooled) on a knit sheet during the night absorbs more easily and is less likely to irritate baby\'s skin, as well.  Just feel the difference between the two and ask yourself which one you would rather have on your bed.  Gerber sheets are excellent quality for the price, as well.  I highly recommend these sheets!",5

"152","Britax Boulevard 70 Convertible Car Seat, Silver Birch","I had to cool off before writing this review because I had just gone through TWO installations of this seat in a 1997 Toyota Rav4 and an 2003 Infiniti G35. I bring this up because one car has a lot of room to install this seat ""properly"" and the other is a tight nightmare.Neither of these cars has the floor LATCH system so you have to use either the middle lap belt method or set the seat to one side and use the shoulder/lap belt method.The first problem that is evident is that you run the belt through the base almost at the very front for the rear facing setup. This seat is large and heavily weighted in the back, yet it\'s attachment point is in the front. So, no matter how tightly you lock this down (I\'m 6 feet and 260lbs so I can really press it into the seat) all you\'ve done is make one strong attachment point while the back (which is the head rest area) and swing around. I think this would be a really bad setup in any accident other than head-on.For front facing setup, the belts go through the rear of the base and higher up at an angle that looks like it would lock into the seat nicely. It would also have very little motion in an accident.Overall, don\'t buy this seat unless your child is near the front facing age. I\'m going to try this briefly but I suspect they\'ll get chucked in favor of something that locks in better like our previous seats.",1

"161","Tilty Slow Flow Cup Lids, 2 Pack","These lids fit fine and are spill proof as far as I have encountered, but I haven\'t tossed them into a diaper bag where they have been turned all about.Unfortunately they require you to remove the ""sippy"" lid and replace it with this one, so when you want your child to use the cup, you have to take the travel lid off and replace it with the regular lid. So you have the problem of having to carry around the regular lids and swicth them back out when your child is done drinking. Not very convenient when you are traveling. You might as well bring the drink in a bottle or something and pour it into the Tilty.Or you can put the travel lid on top of the regular lid but it doesn\'t create a seal of any kind and just sort of rests on top, which works only if you are just wanting to prevent sloshing spills when putting it in a stroller or car cup holder.I love the Tilty cups, I have 4 and they are all I really use.

"164","Diono Monterey Booster Seat, Blue","First, let me say that I have 2 Sunshine Kids Monterey boosters - one from 2009 & one from 2010.  Had no problems w/ either of these - they are awesome products!  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the Dion 2012 model.I recently ordered the 2012 model and experienced nothing but problems w/ the quality.  First one arrived w/ numerous quality issues from the factory, as did the second.  That in itself was a huge surprise/disappointment, but I also question the modified design of upper seat belt guide.  Has anyone else experienced this?The new upper seat belt guide design makes for a sleek, understated appearance (which I love), but I question whether it actually works.  Since I ended up returning both seats due to quality issues, I only had the opportunity to briefly install the new model.  What I noticed was that the upper guide is actually obstructed by the head cushioning.  Additionally, it is very narrow and appears to sit back much farther/deeper on the head rest, so the belt doesn\'t glide smoothly.  I found that the seat belt would either not retract (due to rubbing on the cushion + the narrow track), or it would quickly come out of the track.  As any parent knows, having a seat belt that doesn\'t retract when your child leans forward is almost like not having them restrained at all!  After threading the seat belt though the guide, it would fall out of the inner side of the track with just one pull (while just extending the belt far enough to buckle), and ultimately, it would disengage entirely and the seat belt functioned as it would with a bottom only booster with no upper guide.  Even though my kid is tall enough that the belt did not hit his neck, I think this could be a problem with a shorter child.Overall, I was very disappointed with new model.  Even if there had not been issues with the quality of workmanship (which were unacceptable), I don\'t think I would have kept this seat.  I noticed that the IIHS booster test for 2011 models shows an image of the 2011/12 Diono booster with this exact upper belt threader - so I have to say I\'d love to see some other posts from anyone who has this latest model.  Did anyone else have this threading issue and found a workaround for it?  Maybe it\'s just my cars (tried it in both of them).",2

They kind of feel like a favorite old t-shirt that you\'ve worn a bunch and is soft and cozy.  I didn\'t find the thinness upsetting at all; it\'s not threadbare.We washed these before using them to make them as soft as possible and they fit my crib\'s mattress with a little room to spare!

"167","Peg Perego Aria MT Lightweight Stroller","It\'s not worth it for paying for $199 for this stroller.  So save money for soemthing else!1) It\'s very hard to stire (drive/move around) the stroller only after using 3 months.  Wheels keep going to one direction and you have to constantly apply the force to redirect the stroller.  It\'s very tireing.  Everyone who ended up pushing olur stroller ""noticed!"" about it.  Something that cost you almost $200 should not have such a problem.  Easy to move around is Must HAVE quality for the stroller.FYI, I didn\'t abuse the stroller, by taking to mountain or trail walk, this start happening after the normal usage of shopping and light neighbor walk.2) The cup holder on the handel keep pupping off!  Unbeliable cheapo quality!  I couldn\'t believe it!3) Harnest is keep crambling off from the back seat area, because there is only one hock to keep the harnest. The hock is short and doesn\'t lock, so everytime, you take harnest off from kid, it easily come off the hock.  It doesn\'t stay in the position.  It was so annying to set it back everytime before you put kids back on the seat...so now, i gave up and my kids just sit on them.  I wish they designed in a way the shoulder straps come out from the back of the seat pad and stable position.BUT IFyou don\'t care about money, and above low qualities, it\'s great one to have for the reason for a light weight and big and easy to use storage after all.",2
"168","Safety 1st Magnetic Locking System","I purchased this set of locks for our son\'s dresser- he kept pulling out all of his clothes, sheets and blankets and I got tired of picking it all up at the end of every day. We had bought another kind of childproof lock and put those on the drawers beneath his changing table, but those did not block his access 100%, he could still get his hand in the drawer and pull whatever out.That is not the case with these locks, WHEN they work, they are awesome! I have two on his dresser right now and he has yet to be able to open the drawers! (YAY!)The locks were reasonably simple to install (like the other reviewer said, take care not to drill through the drawer front!) probably the best installation process I have come across for child-proofing items. If you\'re like me and have to use scissors or something sharp to open the package and rip up the directions in the process, you can find directions and a video online for the installation.One of the locks works flawlessly, I haven\'t had a single problem with it latching closed or opening smoothly, however, the other lock is a different story. It is tricky to unlock nine times out of ten (with the other one, I just pass the ""key"" over the area and wait for the ""click"" and then pull the drawer open, with the troublesome lock, I have found it\'s best to let the ""key"" hang (the magnets will catch)and give it a second and then with the ""key"" still hanging, attempt to open the drawer. Also, it doesn\'t latch properly about half of the time, my husband got an outfit out of the drawer and didn\'t check to be sure it latched correctly (we didn\'t know about this issue at that point) and much later that day I went to tuck our little one in for a nap and found several of his shirts in the floor and the drawer stark wide open! It very well could be an installation flaw on my part, I plan on trying to re-install that lock set or maybe switch it out for one of the extras, I think the latch part that is secured to the dresser ""body"" is a tad crooked.Overall, I would buy this again and I would recommend it to a friend because it is better than most childproof locks I have seen or used, but it is still a bit of a hassle. I would say if you were going to use several of these locks in different rooms, to purchase more keys or magnets of similar strength because they key somewhat small (a bit bigger than a marshmellow) and it might easily get lost having to tote it room to room.",4

The rest of the play bar is fine but a little hard to get off when we want it off.Now she\'s 9 months old and has figured out how to put her little feet on the orange frame pieces and climb completely out. A couple times we turned around and she was already on the floor. Thankfully she wasn\'t hurt. :( It could definitely use a seat belt! And the leg holes should be much smaller too. They\'re so big she could probably fit her whole body through one of them!We didn\'t have any problems with it being too short; if anything it was too tall for her to touch the ground until she was 7 months old. Now she really zooms around in this thing on our hardwood floors.It makes a great place for feedings.

"194","Safety 1st Sounds n Lights Discovery Walker, Dino","Like any first time parents, we wanted a walker for our baby in hopes he\'ll learn to walk soon. It was hard to decide on one as there was no reference on what the minimum height should be and I was worried that our boy is still too early for a walker. So for your reference, our baby is about 3.5 months, and 2 feet tall when we purchased this walker. With the lowest setting, he is still not able to reach the ground. However, we were able to make some adjustments to it to make it lowered so that his feet can now reach the ground and he is able to push himself backwards.The toys on the tray are ok. I thought they were a bit simple and not very entertaining: the bear at the end flashes a red light and plays 3 different sounds, the palm tree has rotating mirrors, the dinosaur turns and clicks, the yellow ball spins with tiny balls inside so it also makes noise, and a red plastic toy tied to the tray and our boy ends up just putting it in his mouth. I liked how the toys has its own tray and you are able to move them to the side so you can use the tray for snacks or other toys.The only thing we didn\'t like about this walker is the design of the seat. The two holes for his legs are way in front where his legs dangle instead of allowing him to stand up and move freely. I hope they will reconsider the design to either make the leg holes wider or move it to the middle of the seat more.Overall, this is walker is affordable, simple to use and set up, slides effortlessly on hardwood floor, and great for travel as the seat can be lowered to flatten. Also, the cloth seat is removable for washing when it gets soiled. It\'s a good buy!",3

"201","Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System","I have had the ""new and improved"" daiper genie for about 14 months. At first it worked great: no smell at all. Then everything went to he** in a handbasket. First the lid broke off the top, now everytime I put a diaper in I have to reposition the lid. Second, the twister part on the lid broke so I have to turn the plastic ring on the inside the get it to ""tie off"" the daipers. Third, the cutter on the lid got worn down or something and it catches all the time and we have alot of problems getting it cut the bag. Fourth, after having it for so long, my nursery stinks to high heaven. I do change my genie often and it\'s like the smell is imbedded into the plastic so no matter what I do to clean it, it smells awful. And as a personal complaint, I can\'t stand that I have to either tip the genie on its side or lift the whole thing up off the floor while holding the trashbag underneath it to empty it. This can be very difficult to do and (on rare occasion when I haven\'t gotten a good enough tie on the end) a daiper comes flying out the top if I don\'t get every ""sausage"" in the trash bag on the first try. This is very disgusting. Does anyone else have that problem?P.S.-I have a 1 and 2 year old and use the stage 2 daipers. I am going to try a Neat! Diaper Disposal system and see how well it works.",2

"211","DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry","I purchased this to go with my Davinci Emily 4-in-1 crib.  My husband and father worked together to put this piece of furniture together.  They said that it was a pain, but that all it really took was a lot of patience and a little bit of extra time.  I didn\'t experience any problems with the varnish smelling badly.  As others have mentioned, if you don\'t want a piece that shows wear, you might want to look at something else.  This is made of very soft wood (pine), so dents show easily.  However, the oak color does a nice job of making the wear and tear less obvious than on darker models.  The price on Amazon was great--the best I found!  Shipping was good and the product arrived undamaged.  The one thing to think about before you purchase is the set up of your nursery and where you plan to put this.  While it\'s a great space saver, if you don\'t have a space where it will work to have the changing table piece on the left, this might not be for you.  Ours ended up in a corner in a slightly less than ideal position because I didn\'t think about this before hand.The bottom line is, I would definitely buy this piece again.

It has a waterproof nonallergic top layers so you don\'t have to worry about ""fluids"" absorbing and it doesnt make a plastic noise when you push down on it, it was firm enough but still a little soft to comfort baby, also has a 15 year warranty.I have yet to see a bad review for this mattress, and I personally recommend this mattress to my friends.",5

I guess you get what you pay for because this pump did nothing but cause me problems. I ended up getting blocked milk ducts multiple times which eventually turned into mastitis. when I told my lactation consultant what type of pump I was using, she said the Ameda pumps are infamous for causing problems because the suction does not in any way mimic a baby\'s natural rhythm (like the Madela) and does not empty the breasts properly.So by saving about $100 on this pump, I ended up costing myself a couple trips to the doctor, antibiotics, a month rental fee for a hospital grade pump and accessories AND I ended up having to buy the Madela pump anyways so I don\'t have to go thru all this again.",1

"226","Kolcraft Universal Infant Car Seat Carrier","I have a Graco Snug Ride II carseat...I selected this stroller frame because I had a gift certificate that covered the cost of it so it would be free.Upon assembly, we attempted to attach the car seat to the stroller frame.  The instructions made it look like the back part of the car seat should snap onto the frame.  Our car seat does not.Called customer service, got a prompt friendly associate on the phone who informed me that Graco Snugride II will not snap onto this frame, but that the safety strap should adequately secure the seat to the frame.So for that, I take away one star.However, the other four stars are well deserved.  Here\'s why:1. It fits in the trunk of my Honda Civic with room to spare.2. It is lightweight.3. You truly CAN open and close it with one hand, LOVE THIS!!4. The ride is SMOOTH regardless of terrain.5. The handle is just right for a 5 ft 2 mom.  No back strain or arm tiredness from improper height.6. The basket on the bottom is SPACIOUS and easy to access.  Big ole diaper bag and Mom\'s purse fit nicely.7. The parent tray is spacious and holds keys.As for a recommendation, I am on the fence.  I would prefer for the seat to snap onto the frame, this still bothers me.  However, all the other features are important and work well for this product, including availability of customer service to quickly answer questions.  So I would say I am 51% leaning towards a ""Would Recommend"" for the Kolcraft Universal Car Seat Carrier...",4

"228","Withings Smart Baby Monitor, White","We purchased the Withings Smart Baby Monitor with very high hopes. I had been looking for a smart-phone app based baby monitor with our daughter on the way this summer. After researching a few other similar monitors, this seemed to have the most features and relatively good reviews so we ordered it. Before diving into the review, I should note that I work with computers for a living. So I\'m probably a bit more tech savvy than the average user.The Good:Upon opening the package, I was very pleased with the look and construction of the unit. Very clean looking unit without many buttons or lights. Seems like it would fit into any nursery without standing out too much. Unit isn\'t too big, and folds up like a clam shell for easy storage.Setup wasn\'t too difficult. Found the app on the Android market very easily. Instructions were easy to follow, and I was ready to go after connecting to my phone via Bluetooth and connecting my Wifi network. Everything looked pretty good at this point.The Bad:Unfortunately the good feeling didn\'t stick around long. After I was up and running, I immediately noticed how poor the video frame rate and video quality were. I realized that this would be a huge issue once we were using it with our daughter because the lag almost made the monitor unusable. Without exaggerating, there was at least a 1-2 second lag between live movement and seeing movement on my phone. Just for reference, the camera, my phone, and my wifi router were all within 10 feet of each other during this trial. There was no difference in lag or quality with using Bluetooth or Wifi. I even tried resetting and re-connecting everything from the beginning, but ended up with the same result.I wanted to review the night-vision and other features, but the lag and quality were so bad that I honestly couldn\'t give a fair review.Overall, I was very disappointing with the Withings Smart Baby Monitor. For the money, I didn\'t expect a performance this poor. We ended up with a similar product by Motorola, and it has worked great on every test so far.",2
"229","Swift Stroller in Violet","I really had my eye on both the Uppa GLuxe and the Peg Perego Mini Pliko, but they were out of our budget.  I was not familiar with Inglesina but had read good reviews for this nifty little stroller and decided to go with it (after absurdly long research time) and we\'re pleased with it.  It has many of the features of those two models, but was within our means.  We added a $10 black fabric cup and cargo holder to hang on the handles and it is fine and blends in well with everything.  We like the look of the stroller a lot, doesn\'t look flimsy like some other umbrella strollers, and our 2-yr-old daughter loves the purple.  She actually asks to get the stroller out (in the house) and plays with it, pushing it around and getting in and out of it.  Overall, great stroller for the price.  Pros: Full-coverage canopy, 4-position recline, zippered pouch on back of canopy, roomy basket, soft handles, easy maneuvering, 5-point harness that little hands can\'t get undone; Cons: No cup holders, no removable/washable seat cover, no peekaboo window, doesn\'t stand when folded, mechanism that holds it folded doesn\'t keep it folded tightly.",4

"232","OXO Tot Training Cup, Aqua, 7 Ounce","First of all, the review by Kenneth M. Saltzman (one of the top reviews) is right on. If your little one is getting too much liquid, try using two of the covers (called something else I can\'t quite remember) to block more fluid.I first tried these out when my son turned one, but he was just not ready yet. He still was treating it like it was a sippie cup and even if I only put in 2mL, it would still get all over him because it was too much too fast. I didn\'t consider using two of the covers at once, so I just purchased the OXO straw cups of the same size, and they worked perfectly.When little guy turned 15 months, I tried with these again, and he got the hang of it within a few meals. When he was about 18 months, he started to get annoyed by how the covers blocked the liquid, so I just took the covers off, and after a little bit of spills, he can now use a cup like a big boy.I wouldn\'t recommend these for any baby under the age of one, but I would also caution not to expect your little geniuses to get the hang of drinking from these right away. Learning to drink like an adult is difficult stuff for babies. Just put in small amounts of liquid until they get it down, and then when they can really drink like adults, just remove the covers--now you have an &#34;adult&#34; cup for your little one without having to go out and buy something else right away.",NA

Turns out that our baby had borderline Jaundice and it was recommended that he get plenty of fluids so we started supplementing with formula.  I bought this product at target for about the same price as on Amazon.  I didn\'t have the luxury of waiting for delivery.Pros: It works, it\'s simple (just asdd water and you can use the bottles you are going to sterilize to measure the water), it holds a lot, it is compatible with different brands of bottles (we have doc brown and avent), it can hold other non feeding items that need sterilization, lid clips eliminate accidentaly opening after use lessening chane for steam burnsCon: no steam vent to release pressure before opening, no indication that proper temperature/time has elapsed for thorough sterilizationResponses to other comments: water comes out everywhere when opening - sure some water comes out some of the time, but if you open it carefully it\'s a minor to non-issue.  Unsure if it\'s BPA free - of course i wish we knew for sure if it was BPA free, but in the end nothing on this product will go into my baby\'s mouth so it\'s a nonissue for us.  I\'m not chemist, but my understanding is that BPA is a chemical compound that is part of the structure of certain plastics.  it\'s not like BPA can unbind with plastic molecules in this product and magically transfer over and bind with a bottle or nipple.  In my opinion, as long as the bottle and nipple is BPA free, we are comfortable.At the end of the day, i\'m happy with this product.  if i had the luxury to wait for shipping, I would have strongly considered the microwave sterilizer from The First Years as i\'ve had good experiences with that brand and it has a design to address the cons I listed above.",5

On top of it, then only way to get it installed so it kind of works is to rig it so it opens and closed when you lift and swing, which is great unless you have a 3 year old, if you do you may as well not have a gate because they\'ll figure it out in 3.2 seconds.I mean, I guess it\'s great if you want a gate you can\'t open, can\'t close, and is not child proof.

You can\'t fit more than 2 diapers some wipes (not even in a wipe holder) and a 4oz bottle but for when you are just trying to run out quick and not be in an emergency situation this is the bag for you.  I wouldn\'t recommend for longer trips!  Took me one try to understand that the snaps are ONLY to hold on the integrated changing pad and are not how you open and close the bag.  You just have to lift the front of the changing pad and that is the ""flap"" for the bag.  The only issue with that is the magnetic power to keep closed isn\'t that powerful so if you load up the bag you are going to risk it coming open.",4
"252","Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My child loves her ladybug, and I think it\'s really cool. The red doesn\'t show up as well as the blue or green, especially when it\'s not centered in middle of the room, but I\'m afraid to leave it on the floor and risk someone falling over or stepping on and breaking. And my toddler insists on red since that\'s the only color she\'s ever seen a ladybug be. I put up on the dresser against the wall, so the red doesn\'t shine on all the walls, but she doesn\'t mind. The blue and green look really great, even when next to the wall, but like I said, she doesn\'t want those colors right now, lol. It has a 45 minute timer which is perfect for bedtime. Sometimes it will go off while she is still awake, but she knows how to turn it back on. We told her to be careful with and not play with it so it doesn\'t break, and she leaves it right on the dresser.",5
"253","Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","So I am waaaaay too old to have a nightlight, but I have a very, very dark bedroom and enjoy having something interesting to look at as I fall asleep.  Enter: Twilight Turtle.  Man, this little guy is plush enough to cuddle in bed, and bright enough to illuminate my entire 20\'x13\' bedroom.  He has three settings; blue, green and yellow.  I personally usually leave him on yellow, but occasionally set him for blue.  And I swich it by just pressing one of the three easy to feel buttons near his bottom, at the backside of his shell.  He stays automatyically lit for a good 45 minutes before shutting himself off.  He came with batteries, and I\'ve been using him every night for about 2 weeks on those and he\'s still going strong.  I love Him!",5
"254","Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stroller, Blueberry","This stroller is OK. Just OK. We wanted something for our toddler and newborn to share and this is fine but could be a lot better.It\'s not especially light- certainly not \'Ultralight\'- maybe it is lighter than other double strollers but it\'s much, much heavier than a single stroller. Sadly, the extra weight does not mean it is reassuringly safe and solid. We bought this since it was compatible with a Chicco Keyfit car seat, which is a top-rated pick for safety, however it does not \'click\' in, but is in fact merely held in place with a strap which crosses the baby\'s waist and could potentially restrict movement.Also, to attach a car seat means using an attachment which makes the entire stroller so tall when folded that it cannot fit in our trunk (a Prius) without being disassembled each time, which is not convenient in a hot parking lot with crying children. Or even without either of those.",3
"255","JJ Cole Swag Diaper Bag, Silver Drop","I bought this bag because of its looks, but its functionality is AWFUL! It has very little room in the middle of the bag, and the outside pockets are not practical. You can barely fit anything in the zippered pockets either. My keys wouldn\'t fit, but I was able to throw in some chap stick... On top of the space issues I was having, it is also poorly made. The little strap that holds the excess shoulder strap length after you buckle it came out before I was even able to use the bag (before baby was even born). Without that piece, the strap will not stay buckled well. Thankfully Amazon too the defective bag back without much fuss. I would not recommend this bag at all, especially if you plan to be out for more than two hours at a time with baby. I ended up getting the timi & leslie Abby bag. It has a ton more room and also looks like a purse. Also it is made with much better quality. Only thing is, you DO get what you pay for. my abby bag was $125 from zappos.com",NA

I thought the breastshields would be just like the ones that came with the pump; in three pieces.  I was wrong, it only comes in two pieces.  So if you are not a size 24mm then you CANNOT swap out the shields for the right size.  I had already ordered this and the right size shields for myself.  I could not tell from the listing or the picture on the box that it was not one you could swap out so I opened it.  Now I can\'t return it.  I had to order personal fit connectors in addition to everything else.  I am just a little annoyed that it wasn\'t clearly stated and that the kit only exists in the one size.  I realize the listing said to check for other listings to get other sizes but there are none that I can find.  Don\'t make the same assumption I did.",NA
"257","HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn","I registered for and received other swaddle brands.  However one of my mom girlfriends gave me two of these Swaddle SleepSacks as well - one cotton and one fleece.  I really loved them and never used the other brands again.  The sack offers a nice benefit of a gown for your newborn.  It keeps her snuggly and offers easy access for diaper changes.  The swaddle part is awesome for a secure swaddle - there is some serious velcro that allows your baby to stay snug.  The cotton version was perfect for my summer baby (having air conditioning in our home) and the fleece one was great as we entered fall and winter months.  Once baby no longer needs the swaddle the sack is perfect for sleeping, I used a long-sleeve onesie underneath for warmth.  Only caution is while doing laundry - make sure you have all the velcro secure or avoid washing with delicate clothes ~ if the velcro attaches itself to other piece of laundry you may ruin something.  The material/zipper is durable and will last a long time ~ planning on using someday for baby #2. Sizing is accurate according to height/weight.  I have gifted these to friends since and highly recommend them.  This is definitely one of those ""need to own"" baby items.",NA

"271","Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision","UPDATE TO THE BELOW REVIEW:As it turns out, I had a malfunctioning unit, that\'s why the coverage was only 20-25 ft. Also, as it turns out, this company has a very good Customer Service, they just prefer email (hence no one answered my call). Mae emailed me back right away, then she called me when I asked for it and she shipped me a new unit immediately. The very next day I received it (it was expedited) and it was working well. I did not even have to change the cables, since they were the same 0 just swiped the old unit to the new one and voila, it now works well. The coverage is good, it works outside our home.So my suggestion is, if you have COVERAGE problems, contact CS via email (I think they cover this w/in a year - mine was only 3 wks old) and let them send you a functioning one.Besides coverage problem, I love the unit. Simple and clear image.MY OLD REVIEW FOLLOWS:If you live in a studio in Manhattan, this product might be for you. However, if your baby sleeps upstairs or if there are more than one rooms in between nursery and where you are, this product is useless. Here is a description from Infant Optics\' official website (note the 150 ft indoor coverage - absolutely NOT true, it is max 20 or 25 ft!):""2.4 TFT screen with super sensitive built in microphone2.4 GHz static free digital wireless transmission covering distances of up to 800 feet in open areas - or 150ft in enclosed areasUses FHSS (Automatic Frequency Hoping System) - jumps between different channels in the 2.4 GHz.""Also, here is a message from Infant Optics\' CEO (copied from online):""We are passionate about customer service which is why we have a seven-days-a-week customer service hotline with live representatives answering your call within seconds.

It is durable, thick, tight-fitting to the mattress and really holds the sheets well.  I find that the few times that it has been washed/drying and I\'ve had to put a sheet on the mattress that the sheets slide off easily.We only invested in 1 of these due to the price and our uncertainty of how well it would work.  I would easily buy another, if I felt that we needed to.  Easy to wash with the sheets and blankets, but due to it\'s durability, it does take a while to dry thoroughly, but that is simply not enough for me to rate this product less than a 5.

Once my baby was a little older it still wasn\'t useful because the swing is very slow and the seat is simply not comfortable. Furthermore it\'s bulky and doesn\'t travel well.

I was a little nervous because I didn\'t have the chance to go down to my local Babies R Us and see if it would actually FIT in my cars; I have a 2008 Scion xB and a 2001 Honda Civic sedan. I read a lot of the reviews and found that they fit perfectly....in SUV\'s and minivans! This added to my nervousness. I KNEW I wanted this seat, but I was concerned with the fact that it just might not fit in our cars. We got the seat day before last and it fits WONDERFULLY...in BOTH cars!

And  we contacted the company back in October regarding this, and still have no resolution. It\'s a waste of $300.

"293","Britax Decathlon Convertible Car Seat, Tiffany","Almost everything is perfect: fine quality velour fabric , very adorable floral print, super soft and comfortable cushion and infant-positioning-pillows system. We have a Honda Accord and the chair fits comfortably in the back seat (we have a 3 months old girl). Ofcourse my husband and I are not very tall and we don\'t need to move our front seats further back so it still has enough room for the chair in the reclined rear-facing position (I can see that it would be a hassel for tall people who sit in front with any rear-facing chair right behind their backs). I find the 3-point-harness-positioning buckle EXTREMELY helpful which the Marathon and the Boulevard designs don\'t have (the Marathon also doesn\'t have any infant-positioning-support pillows and with the Boulevard, the body-support pillow is too big for infants and the head-support-wings block the side-views of todlers). Our daughter is only 13 lbs but I have to move the harness buckle to the middle position already for her to be comfortable. The chair is also easy to install and stays sturdy. I really love it except 2 things which I\'m not so fond of: 1/ the comfort pads are too short to keep the baby\'s chin and neck from touching the edge of the harness straps. I had to buy a different pair of pads to use instead. 2/ It\'s a little bit difficult to tighten or loosen the harness straps. I have to push the button really hard to make it work. Maybe I just have to get used to it. Overall, it\'s still a very good chair and the reward is that our baby doesn\'t cry any more any time we take her out for a ride now. It\'s worth the money.",NA

"299","Munchkin Fresh Feeding Set","I had high hopes for this food grinder.  The fresh food feeder is okay--my 8-month old likes eating cantaloupe from it.  But I was very disappointed by the grinder.  Here\'s why:1) The grinder is shaped awkwardly.  You have to hold onto the upright middle part of the grinder while pushing downward so the food gets pushed up to the grinding blade.  It can be hard to apply enough downward pressure to do this, and it\'s fatiguing to push down with one hand while grinding with the other.2) It takes a lot of effort to grind just a little bit of food.  It took me about 2 minutes of grinding to get less than 1 ounce of ground green beans.  8 minutes of grinding by hand to get a 4-ounce feeding while the baby is hungry?  No thank you!3) Ground food is too course for my 8-month old baby.  I tried feeding him two bites from the grinder, and he gagged so hard he almost threw up.  Maybe it\'s okay for babies eating ""Stage 3"" foods, but not for younger babies.4) The grinder is hard to disassemble.  During assembly, you rotate the metal disk into the base of the bowl so it doesn\'t come loose while grinding.  But there\'s no easy way to get the metal disk back out for cleaning.  I ended up having to use a fork to pry/rotate the metal disk out.I\'m taking the grinder back and getting a food processor instead.",2

(yes, it\'s a frog.  i asked evenflo, and despite my suggestion that it\'s a dragon, they\'ve insisted it\'s no more fantastic than a mere amphibian.  albeit with a crown.  and front flippers.  yeah, i know, it\'s clearly a dragon.  but go figure.  and i lost a bet with my wife, and had to clean the bathroom as a result of losing.  so thanks evenflo, thanks for putting a frog in there.)my boy ethan is also a strong little man, so i don\'t know how long some of the toys will last, at least connected to the platform.  he\'s liable to start pulling some of them free soon.  i\'m resigned to that, as i think the toy platform is slightly too crowded as it is.  the natural process of using the toy will clearly fix that.i\'ll tell you this: it was a snap to install, and the design impressed me.  it has some logical design elements I like: the seat basket snaps it easy but securely, the legs are strong, the base solid.would i recommend an Exersaucer?  yes, i would.  However, i might not recommend the ultra, perhaps because of the toy clutter.  the next level down might have enough toys evenly-spaced out for your child.Fred",4
"308","Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo","We bought this Jumperoo for my son when he was about 4 months old.  It was very easy to assemble - my 8 year old son saw to that part.For my other three children, we used the type that hangs out of the door frame.  That was also a lifesaver and this works very much on the same principal however is more of an interactive "" playstation"" as I would refer to it.He absolutely LOVED it from day one. In the beginning, we would have to swivel the seat around ourselves when he had enough of one certain toy. That was and is not a problem, because now at 5 months and 2 weeks he can do it all by himself. I also put a small little mat under his feet cos he cannot quite reach the floor to jump up and down but now is also not a problem, he can do it by himself.What I thought might be a bit of a white elephant or non starter was the bee that flops.  He actually loves it and into the mouth it goes and when its not in the mouth he has it between his little fingers. He LOVES that bee.This Jumperoo gets me at least 20 mins peace and quiet at any given time. It is safe and the little tunes do not get on your nerves the way many tunes and melodies can do. He cries when he has had enough and out he comes, easy.My other three children, 13, 11 and 8 years get great enjoyment out of watching him jump up and down and of course they jump beside him also and in turn makes him want to jump and giggle more.This is a GREAT BUY.We are delighted with it.",5

"311","Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump","I had a fever in the hospital and they did not allow me to feed my baby until my fever broke. So as a result, they gave her a bottle in the nursery. Needless to say, weaning her to my breast was not easy and very, very frustrating. To further complicate matters, when my milk came in, I was so engorged that it was taking her twice the work to get anything. I was using a mini electric to relieve the engorgement which was not working well at all. I was fed up and I decided to pay the extra money to buy this pump because of all the great reviews. I am so happy I did because I was able to relieve the engorgement enough so that she was able to feed. I was able to wean her to the breast in less than a day after using the pump. And, when she is done with one breast and doesn\'t want the other, I am able to empty it in less than 10 minutes (sometimes even just 5 minutes!). I highly recommend this pump because it saved my baby from being on formula.",5

It\'s easy to wash and fold. The music and lights are above the baby to see.On the Gymni the baby has to be on his tummy to see the lights.

The pocket is big enough to catch food pieces and liquid. It\'s easy to clean and dry up fast.However I wish the velcro strap does not comes undone so easily. My girl @13 months is able to pull it off her neck.  I also wish the neck/chest area can be slightly bigger to provide more coverage. Every time my girl turns her head side to side, food would get smudged on her shoulder.Other than the high $ investment- I think it\'s probably the best one out there next to Bumkins!",4
"317","Child Airplane Travel Harness - Cares Safety Restraint System - The Only FAA Approved Child Flying Safety Device","I bought this for our 26-month-old son, who weighs about 27 pounds and is of average height.Attaching the harness to the seat was the first problem. I\'m pretty savvy with carseats, straps, carriers, and all manner of child securing. However, once the straps were slipped over the seat and tightened, I realized the top strap was twisted, so the straps/buckles were flipped backwards. I wrestled with the straps for a while and finally gave up on fixing it; I could not get the straps to release.The second issue arose when fastening my child in. It simply didn\'t fit, no matter how much I adjusted the straps and buckles. The chest buckle was too high on my son, almost near his clavicle to start. It worsened as he slid down the leather seat (as others have noticed, there is no strap between the legs, so if you have a slim/shorter/wiggly child on leather/vinyl seats, you\'re SOL). And even with the buckle *kind of* in place, the straps were too loose down his torso: i.e., useless.The final straw was when the child behind me mentioned that she couldn\'t open her tray table. The flight attendant informed me that in order for her to use her table, I\'d have to remove the straps during flight. What, and then reinstall them?Fail, fail, and fail. I used the seatbelt across his lap and prayed we didn\'t crash, which we didn\'t, thank the heavens.A complete waste of money and time.",1

"326","Safety 1st Complete Care Bath Center","I got this product as a hand-me-down from a friend, and I only have the tub and the sling, so I can only comment on those items.  I started out bathing my little guy in the kitchen sink, but it was inconvenient to make sure the sink was clean at bathtime (because with a newborn, who KNOWS when the dishes will get done, right?).  So I put this sling and little tub into the ""grownup"" bathtub and filled the little tub halfway.  It was great!  I love that the sling gently held the baby\'s head above the water, so I didn\'t have to keep a hand under him the whole time and therefore had both hands free to wash all his little bits.  I could fill the little tub halfway in about 30 seconds, and empty it instantly by turning it over and dumping the water.  The little drain plug is a joke.  Not only would it take forever for the water to come out through the tiny hole, but it\'s on the bottom and flush with whatever surface is underneath, so you have to hold the tub up a bit for the water to come out.  Might as well tip and dump.  Once my little guy got to be about 24"" long, this little tub was too short (he likes to kick) and we switched to thePRIMO EuroBath Transparent Blue.",NA

I don\'t think it is a problem with the seat per se, but you may have some trouble with it, depending on the type of car you drive. The feature I like the most is the \'infinity head rest\'.

"332","Fresh N Freeze 2 oz. Reusable Baby Food Containers 12-Pack","This is a fairly good product for storing batches of homemade baby food. Like several other reviewers, I prefer to make my own baby food. Not only do I know exactly what is going into everything, but stuff is just better fresh. (Ever opened canned ""peas""...they don\'t look very appetizing to me, so I know she won\'t want it.)Pros/Cons:Pro & Con: First of all, they are very small (only holding 2 oz, like they say). This means you typically won\'t get a full meal out of just one container unless your baby is just starting on solids. However, this can be a good thing, especially if you like to mix flavors like I do. If my baby is having a hard time with a new food, I can mix it with something she likes already.Pro: I love the way you can stack them on top of each other, and they stick together. This is especially a space saver. (Which is nice for someone with a small fridge like we have.) For this feature alone I prefer this product to other storage containers that out there.Con: The lids don\'t screw on tight enough. As mentioned in other reviews, if you fill it up too much, the lids can come unscrewed and create a big mess. (In the freezer with the expansion of most foods, the lids often become loose.) If they just added one more row to the existing threads (meaning a slightly bigger lid) this would be an excellent product.",4

"355","Chicco Keyfit Caddy Stroller Frame","I\'m SO glad that I got this caddy stroller to use as the primary stroller for my son for the first 3-4mo of his life.  Originally (before I knew any better!) I was thinking of buying a ""travel system"" including carseat and stroller .. in fact I was looking at the Chicco system, since I knew I wanted a Chicco carseat.  THE CADDY IS SO MUCH BETTER!  For the following reasons:- The Chicco full-size stroller is only so-so .. definitely not the highest rated in its class, and not one I would ever consider purchasing as my primary stroller on a standalone basis.  Why then consider buying a so-called ""travel system,"" when the carseat will actually work with lots of other stroller bases?- The Chicco caddy is SUPER convenient and lightweight - very easy to fold up and store in the car, then open up and pop baby in and out when running around town doing errands.- Handling is very good and it\'s actually pretty versatile, more versatile than you might think given how lightweight/portable it is.  It\'s definitely not an all-terrain stroller (the wheels aren\'t large or robust enough), but we took it on some walks on mostly flat dirt trails (nothing too bumpy/crazy), and it held up just fine.You may also be considering the Snap n Go generic caddy stroller, especially because it\'s so much cheaper than the Chicco.  I struggled with the same thing, and am SO glad that in the end I bought the Chicco caddy made specifically for Chicco carseats.  The Chicco carseat audibly snaps into the Chicco caddy and is much more securely attached than it would be on the Snap n Go (where there is no ""click,"" and you are supposed to manually close a strap over the carseat every time you attach it).  Otherwise, I found the two stroller caddies to be pretty similar, in terms of ride/handling, quality/materials, etc.  But the greater security/safety & convenience (not having to use the strap) of the Chicco caddy were good enough reasons for me to spring for it.It\'s expensive, and you may only use this item for a few months, but for us it was worth it.  I suspect that the resale value on these will actually be pretty good as well (given that it\'s a pretty new item and there aren\'t many used ones on Craigslist etc. yet), so in the end you may even be able to recoup much of what you paid!",5

I contacted Amazon and they said the description doesn\'t mention 2 shells (only 1) so there\'s nothing they can do about that. I said there are 2 pictures showing the other shell, and they told me in a very condescending tone, ""We undertand that ma\'am but it is not our fault you didn\'t read the description.""

As far as its use as a walker, it is VERY sturdy. We have owned plastic walkers in the past and this one is substantially sturdier (as in, it won\'t tip over as easily when baby pulls up on it) It does require some basic assembly, I think it was just putting two screws in. The wheels have a rubber ring around them so it gets very good traction on wood or carpeted floors. As the toy is pushed the alligators open and close their mouths at regular intervals. Great fun for chomping sisters\' barbie dolls. All three of my boys (ages 1, 2, and 4) LOVE this toy and frequently fight over it (so that could be good OR bad depending on how you look at it!) The only caveat to this toy is the NOISE, when pushed quickly it lives up to the \'clack\' part of the name, it clacks LOUDLY. That is the only reason I didn\'t give this toy a 5.

"369","Nautica Kids William Crib Sheet","I love the pattern - I like that it\'s subtle and not as kiddy as some nautical theme nursery decor - but after a single wash/dry cycle, following the recommendations on the tag, there are already dozens of tiny holes and threadbare patches running near the elastic! It also seems thinner than crib sheets I have from other brands.",2

"371","Stokke Tripp Trapp Highchair, Red","We debated long and hard about the Tripp Trapp after seeing the scary video of a child pushing himself over backwards on youtube. I think the most important thing for anyone thinking about buying this chair to consider is what your flooring and table design is like. We have hardwood floors plus a table with a fairly shallow lip. After thinking through how the chair works, we decided to give it a try and for our dining set up and for our 11 month old son, it works perfectly. We\'ve been using it for about 5 months now and are as happy now with it as we were at first. We love having him sitting right at the table with us and he\'s super comfortable sitting in the chair, especially with the place to set his feet. I love how adjustable the seat and foot rest are. The only thing I\'d mark down on the chair design is the harness - it\'s a little tricky to adjust and can be difficult to get secured. Other than that, I\'m happy we bought this when our son was young, it\'s going to be used for a long time in our family.Pros:*Excellent design & manufacturing*Lots of options for adjustment, fairly easy to adjust (except harness)*Nice to all eat at the same table*Durable*Nice looking*ComfortableCons:*Harness is a little tricky to adjust*Be aware of the flooring and table design you plan on using this withAdditional note: we considered buying the infant set to use with the chair, since we got the chair when our son was about 6 months old. We decided not to purchase that based on reviews here on amazon and elsewhere, and I\'m glad we didn\'t spend the money on it. I highly recommend getting this placemat to use with the chair to protect your table:Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Green",5
"372","OXO Tot Whale Pail, Blue","I love the white OXO whale pail, looks sleek compared to the blue one. The suction cups worked well for me, unlike other reviewers who could not get them to stick. Its really 2 peices, one side stays on the bath wall, while the other with the handle can be lifted off. Neat idea, but I think it will fall off easily. I don\'t know about other kids, but mine have aquired quite a few bath toys and hardly any will fit in this pail. I had to pick a few toys to put in it and store the rest  in a bath cabinet. So, the 4 star review is for the lack of space inside this whale pail. If your looking for something to hold alot of toys, this is NOT it. But, if you want something for a few toys, sleek, not tacky..then this is for you.",4
"373","JJ Cole Mode Diaper Tote Bag, Cocoa Tree","I love this diaper bag. It has great space, many pockets, and so cute. But, it didn\'t come with care instructions and anything wet will leave a water mark. Not the best thing when it comes to a baby diaper bag.",4
"374","Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali","i love this nursing cover!! i really like the prints and colors! it is a bit pricey for a piece of fabric but Amazon offered the best price compared to babies r us. i have used this in nearly every public establishment, including a tiny crowded japanese restaurant where our table was next to a bunch of business men and the chairs had open backs. nobody around us, but the people we were with, knew that i was nursing. i am a very modest person and i do not feel exposed when i use this at all. however, i do think the cover could be a tad larger as mine shrunk a bit in the wash and i think the terry cloth pockets are not useful. i wouldn\'t put my baby\'s pacifier in there as it touches dirty surfaces. my baby doesn\'t have a problem being under the cover but she does emerge pretty sweaty when she is done nursing.",4

"381","Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump","I love this pump.  It is quiet, comfortable, easy to use, makes pumping time faster etc.  I tried the small Medula electric pump (yellow one) and it hurt and was noisy.  Couldn\'t talk on the phone while pumping for sure- people would always know I was pumping.  This pump is pricey but worth it.  It saves you money on formula.  Unfortunately I could only pump for about 8 weeks because my milk  started to slow down quite a bit, plus at my job it is near impossible to pump during the day.  There is only one bathroom for men and women and I share an office with two other people.  I will use again if we ever have a second child.  Maybe this next baby will latch on (which helps produce more milk) next time.  I started trying to breastfeed a little to late with this baby b/c she was born during Hurricane Rita.  The extra stress and delayed start of trying to breastfeed didn\'t help my milk production.  I still think 8 weeks of using this pump was worth the $320.",5

"391","MamaDoo Kids Foldable Play Yard Mattress Topper, Blue","I thought this item would be included in my free amazon super saver shipping but it was not so I paid an extra 12.99 for shipping. Considering the cost of the item itself, I think this is a little much. I read some reviews about the smell but there weren\'t THAT many that noticed it, so I purchased the product - but there is a distinct plasticky/chemically smell.The cover is 97% cotton and 3% spandex, the body filling is 100% polyurethane foam.After contacting customer service, I am going to attempt to wash the foam in the bathtub and air it out as they suggested. I really do like the way it fits and the portability of this. I just need ot get rid of this smell. Luckily, I have 7 weeks until the baby is born!Here is my response from customer service:Dear April,Thank you for purchasing our MamaDoo Kids Mattress Topper!We are so sorry to hear about the smell, and for any inconvenience.We carry very little inventory and keep up with demand in real time which means your Mattress Topper was actually manufactured less than 1 week before you received it.  Our foam is made in the US, and freshly cut foam will always smell because of its components, especially high quality dense foam like ours.  This odor is common in many mattress products, as you can read here:Sleep Products Safety Council at: [...]eHow Home:  [...]After much research, and speaking directly with the chemists at our foam manufacturer Future Foam, as well as the Executive Director of the Polyurethane Foam Association we are pleased to share that our foam is non-toxic and does NOT contain any cancer causing chemicals mentioned in many recent articles, including the New York Times:[...]Our MamaDoo Mattress Topper does NOT contain:Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE\'s)PenteBDEOctaBDEDeca BDEChlorinated Tris (TCEP)Brominated Trisor over 50 other restricted and banned substances in both the European Union and the United States.Our foam follows the regulations and programs of \'restricted or banned substances\' which include EU REACH, SVHC, RoHS, TIP, cRoHS, CPSIA, and is certified by CertiPUR-US for durability, content, indoor emissions, and environmental stewardship.[...]We recommend that you give it a bit more time to air out.  For best results remove the foam pieces from the cover and lean them against the wall in a well ventilated area, so that all sides receive equal ventilation. If you chose to wash the foam pieces you could try washing them in the bathtub. We have never washed them in a washer but maybe with cold water it is not a problem... The foam dries very fast if it is in a dry and well ventilated area.We admire your safety concerns for your baby, no doubt you are a great mom.  Sorry again for any inconvenience.  Please, contact us again should you have any other questions or concerns, we want to make sure you are happy with your purchase :)p.s.Most products are manufactured overseas these days and much of the foam found in those products have months to air-out when they sit in containers on ships, trains and trucks.  We made the proud choice to manufacture in California USA... so your product is truly fresh and new, made with high quality non-toxic components.",4

"394","BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red","This is simply the best slip-over potty seat out there.  The adjusting dial underneath allows it to fit snugly over oblong or round toilet seats, so there\'s no slipping around on the potty.  I recommend this especially for boys because it doesn\'t require a special flip-up piece in the front.  Also, the hole is a little bigger than the cheaper models, so I would recommend this for average-sized 3+ kids.  My son is over 5 now, and he still has to use this, so it defintely will last a long time as far as age of the child and sturdiness of the product.  It cleans up easily, too.",5

My only complaint is that the red plastic buttons used to collapse it are a little hard to squeeze and I wish it had a little bigger storage basket.  There\'s so much to carry when you have a diaper bag and shopping bags, and coats!  I\'ve seen other brands with bigger baskets but babies r us only had this brand.  But the price is unbeatable.

I washed it and dried it according to instructions and a big chunk of the stitching let go.  The trim on the edge was coming off in two 8-inch areas.  Everything else with it was perfectly fine, so it didn\'t make sense to return it as I had found the perfect print.  So I sewed around the ENTIRE edge to make sure all the thread was secure.

"400","Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker","I did not use this item since it actually arrived damaged and so it was returned. Then, I chose to purchase a FOOD STEAMER (Nesco brand since it\'s the only one that is BPA free at this time) instead of getting a replacement Beaba. I am glad I did this!The Beaba is small and makes enough food for your baby... however I found that my baby who is now one years old eats ALOT of steamed foods (veggies, eggs, rice, etc.) about FOUR TIMES A DAY and that if I had gone with the Beaba I know I would have had to keep steaming and washing, steaming and washing the thing for each meal almost. With a food steamer I throw in all my food in the morning, turn it on and I have a whole day\'s worth of steamed foods for the baby, me and my preschooler!

Trying to pry the piece out w/ a screw driver like you\'re supposed to broke the plastic.  I scraped up the gate trying to get those caps out.  Ended up using WD-40 and then was able to pry the piece out.  Other than the major end cap issues installation was a breeze.

Last, but not least, about a week ago (2 1/2 months after starting to use it) it started leaking air so I have to blow it up every day now until I can find the time to find the hole and put duct tape on the hole.

I found it!The stars on the ceiling have been just the thing to keep him relaxed and still in his bed as he waits for sleep.  We have used it as an educational tool by teaching him the constellations and then looking at the real ones in our huge rural ND skies.  But he has also just used the stars to count over and over, stare at for no particular reason, check out the different sizes, and notice how they brighten as the night gets darker, or we close his door and curtains.Meth-exposure is a huge unknown.  It is hard.  It can be trying.  It can be frustrating and hard to understand.  But when you find a product that helps, it deserves 5 stars.  Definitely buy this for your sweet little babies at home, but also consider it for therapy.  We were very happy to find it.",5

They were strong and held my son\'s toys to whatever we linked them to. He also liked that they clanked together when he shook them around. These links are weak. Always coming unlinked from each other and his toys so everything I hook to his stroller, carseat,  highchair, etc., drop on the floor. Not my favorite product.. Wish I could find whoever makes the other kind.",4

"441","Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","My sister has gates to keep her dogs from total house control.  Hers are black and very, very hard to open.  I love these gates!!!  the opening mechanism is easy (I have weak wrists) and the locking mechanism for small children is going to come in handy when my grandchildren visit.  I would definitely recommend this brand and style.  The only thing is that if you have a small Chihuahua (that hasn\'t been over-fed) they can still get through.  My daughter\'s dog weighs  3- 1/2 to 4 pounds and slipped right through.",5

"444","Bright Starts Around We Go Activity Station, Tropical Fun","This is a neat product in that it allows kids to ""walk"" a little while they\'re playing and to move from station to station.  My daughter got bored with the toys on the table pretty quickly though and now after just a few minutes, is ready to get out.  She (6 months) likes the piano part but some of the other toys are either boring or too hard to use (there\'s one that you can push things down and they squeek, but she doesn\'t have the upper body strength to do this).",4

However, I was able to install the Radian 100 with this ""dumb block of foam"" and have my passenger seat nearly all the way back in my 4 door 2012 Honda Civic! Easy to use and really effective. Pay the $10 and save yourself a few inches of space.",5
"447","Britax Vehicle Seat Protector","I purchased this item to go along with a Britax Booster seat.  It works great!  the seat itself fits into the &#34;pocket&#34; perfectly.  There is a lip that covers the front of the seat, so that older children (taller children) will not be resting dirty/muddy feet on the seat itself.  The item is made of a heavy duty silicone type of plastic that is not stiff, but rather pliable and comfortable.  It does not interfere with seatbelt action in either of my autos (a mid size sedan and an suv).  I am very glad i purchased this item!",5
"448","UPPAbaby Vista Travelsafe Travelbag, Black","We bought this bag for our UPPAbaby Vista stroller when we had a few plane trips coming up. The bag itself is sturdy and I have been surprised at how well the zipper and stitching have held up. We gate checked our stroller for the first trip and baggage checked it for the other two. Getting the stroller into the bag is a tight squeeze and we found this a real pain to do at the gate - we used the time waiting at the gate to do this; it would have been awful to do on the bridge. If you plan on gate checking the stroller in this bag then I highly recommend practicing it at home a lot. It also needs a lot of space, potentially making the waiting area or bridge awkward places to bag the stroller. The stroller frame broke on the first (gate-checked) trip and the second (baggage-checked) trip. Both times the break was at the hinge for the footrest. Customer service was great about replacing the frame. From reading another review, it seems that UPPAbaby will ship the replacement to your destination but I did not know this at the time and it was never offered. Even though the TravelSafe program is great to have, I would prefer not to have a broken stroller during the trip. So by the third trip we decided to try packing things around the stroller to give it some extra protection. Of course, this meant having to baggage-check it. The fit of the stroller in the bag around the footrest is tight so packing things around it made it even tighter (hence my amazement at the zipper and stitching quality). We wrapped a blanket around the footrest part of the frame and stuffed bags of diapers, clothes, whatever else behind the footrest and between the footrest frame and body frame to keep the footrest from being pushed back to breaking point. It was a pain but worth it since the stroller arrived in one piece for every leg of the multi-destination third trip. We are now moving to the lighter, easier to pack up, UPPAbaby g-lite stroller and hoping the new stroller will fare better with the g-series travel bag at gate-check.",3
"449","Sealy Cotton Cozy Rest 2-Stage Crib Mattress","First, all baby mattresses (no matter the brand) are shockingly expensive.  For such a small size, they are almost 50% the price of a queen or king size mattress!With the price shock out of the way, we were happy to get this for our second-born.  It is two-sided, meaning one side is for infant and the other size is when they are more of toddler age.The fabric feels soft and far better than our first-born\'s plastic-feeling mattress that looks like it is 100% waterproof because it is so shiny.You can use your hand and easily tell the difference in the two sides and it seems comfortable.  Most importantly, our infant son has no complaints.  This will be a nice mattress when we flip it over for when he is considered a toddler.  Good thinking and glad we don\'t have to buy a different mattress when he is older.",NA

"452","Maya Wrap Lightly Padded Baby Sling-Medium-Bright Stripe","My 8-month-old son and I love this sling. There is a slight learning curve on threading the ring, but once you get it, it\'s so quick and easy to put on.  My son wants to be held often, and this is a great solution so I can still have both hands free to do chores, shop at a store, etc. while he is secure on my hip.  I own several baby carriers, and this is probably his favorite.  I love the lightly padded shoulder, it is more comfortable than the unpadded slings I have.  Sometimes I prefer to grab a back carrier (e.g. a soft-structured carrier or mei tai) because then it\'s easier for me to bend down, as with a sling you still may use one hand to hold the baby in place sometimes.  But for hip carrying, this is top notch.",5

"456","OXO Tot Flip-Top Snack Cup, Green, 5 Ounce","I love the feel of the rubberized grips and the color is great. The top has a flip up lid for easy access, but in truth, the entire top pops off way too easily.  I bet baby would have no problem prying the lid off, because it easily came off while just transporting it in my bag, spilling the contents everywhere.  It would be better if the lid screwed on instead of just being snapped on, and I predict spills will be frequent as a result. You\'ll find dozens of similar products at the 99cent store, but will they be lead and toxin free? Overall, great quality, but the shoddy lid could have been designed better.",3
"457","NoJo Jungle Tales Hamper","This hamper is super cute and the monkey on the cover overlay is simply adorable. Loved that it matched the bedding set, but as the other commenters noted, the wood is not dark as pictured. It didn\'t bother me so much, but I could see how people would be surprised by that when they were expecting one thing and got another. All in all, a cute product but had we not received it from a shower guest, I probably would not have bothered buying it.",NA
"458","Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog","We found this by chance while browsing a local baby store.  After buying just one, my husband thought that maybe we should get more as security blankets always need back-ups.  Glad we did!  We have four - one for my son\'s daycare, and the other three at home (his room, our room, and a spare clean one).  It blankie has helped during sleep training.  Though he doesn\'t seem super attached to it (can sleep without it), we keep it in his crib and when he seems to always take it from side to side as he rotates while sleeping.  It\'s always by his arms.  Very soft and cute.  Have since given it to friends as gifts.",5

The material is super soft and light, making it easy to wrap them up tight.  The design is super cute and now over a year later -they still look brand new.  My 19mo still uses them in the car or when it gets hot outside.  The only con I have is that they are a bit pricey, however, in my opinion well worth the extra money!",5

We used it for baby food jars for months, as the jars got bigger you can adjust the shelves (make sure you rotate till they kind of pop/click or they will collapse). The center blue part also doubles as a spoon holder, which was very nice - everything was in one place. Could squeeze the Gerber tubs on it but they had to go long ways and stuck out a little. We no longer buy baby food, but I still use to keep my spices in order. Who doesn\'t love dual purpose?",5

"468","The First Years Ignite Stroller","I read a lot of reviews on a lot of different umbrella strollers before deciding on this one, color was not important other than I didn\'t want a dark shade.  When it went on sale I made my move.  I mostly bought it to keep in the trunk of my car for outings and emergencies.  It\'s also the middle of winter so I\'ve only used it a handful of times, but it works like it\'s supposed to, and doesn\'t take up my whole trunk like her other stroller.So far it works fine, no wheel problems.  I haven\'t gotten tripped up with the folding latch, but I do need both hands to get it open.  And it is a bit heavier than some, but not terribly cumbersome.  The bag compartment is somewhat blocked, but not big issue for me.The things I was looking for that it has are a 5-point harness system with pads, comfortable lower leg support and foot rest.",4

"470","DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01","I give this product 2 stars rather than one because I really did like the selection of sounds and the option to combine them.  The unit itself was small and lightweight enough to travel with.  However, the sound quality was terrible.  I almost wonder if I got a defective product, or if they are really just that bad.  The timer/on/off switch made a static noise whenever I moved it, almost like it had a short.  The highest volume setting was surprisingly quiet. For a product that is all about making sound, the quality of the sound was pathetic.",2

"481","Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One)","I love this item and we use it almost daily. My daughter\'s eyes light up when I start filling it, she loves it that much! She has tried many more fresh fruits and vegetables than my other kids did at her age. I even put broccoli in it and she devours it.The only downside is that the net can be difficult to clean when very small food particles are embedded. Sometimes the dishwasher doesn\'t get it all, so it has to be scrubbed by hand in addition. For that reason, we bought three extra nets. If I haven\'t had time to clean one, we just grab an extra.Overall, I think this is one of the most useful baby items I\'ve purchased in a while. It beats feeding her nothing but food out of jars.",5

"489","Graco Seatbelt Locking Clip, 2 Pack","When I received the product, I was initally surprised that it was not a Graco brand product as listed in the product description and a shown in the accompanying picture. The item was instead manufactured by Ford and was sent with very generic pacakaging. Since I had never seen the original Graco product, I can\'t say how similar this one is to the original. However, it surprised and disturbed me that the product was described to be a Graco product when it was in fact from another manufacturer.That said, it seemed to work as it was supposed to, though I found it somewhat cumbersome to use. That is just the way the item functions. We received our carseat as a gift and brought while it traveling by plane, and we left the base at home. Without the base, which can attach to the latches, we needed to use seatbelts in the various cars we used while traveling, and therefore needed the clip. It has to be taken on and off each time we put the baby in and out of the car. It was sometimes challenging and often frustrating to get the clip to work properly and actually have the seatbelt be tight enough.In the future, I would consider a different type of car seat system that doesn\'t use this clip.",NA

I am very tiny and have no problem getting it in and out of the car.  It folds very flat - flatter than my single stroller - and lighter.  The best part is that is pushes and turns so easily - it is really nice to take the kids out in it.  I love the five point seatbelt in the front and the seatbelt on the back seat.  I don\'t have a problem with the basket.  The organizer is nice to have, but definitely not as easy to use as a plastic ones on most single strollers.  It does the job though and keeps everything handy.  My son loves this, though.

The drawings and potty poems are so very adorable (and educating!) for kiddos and grow-ups alike.  I really like how durable the game pieces are.

The lining is water resistant and the interior and exterior can be wiped clean. The bag zips closed so the contents can\'t fall out. And what I especially like about this bag is that I can also use it as a travel bag once no longer needed as a diaper bag. I think the exterior looks stylish, I can use the different compartments to separate my travel stuff and I actully like all the colors that it comes in. I would definitely recommend it!",5

We have 2 boys, 4 months apart, so we needed essentially a stroller for twins.  For comparison\'s sake, we\'ve been using a 7 year old Bugaboo Frog and a Graco snap n go.  Of the strollers we considered, only the UppaBaby and the Britax B-Ready were available in town to test.  The Phil & Ted\'s explorer and BJCS were unavailable even though we live in PDX and you would think this city is big enough.  We settled right off the bat on an in-line tandem.  Side by sides are just too obnoxious.  If you\'re on the road in a quiet neighborhood or out in the open, it\'s fine.  But if you\'re on a sidewalk or a path, you force everyone to get out of your way.Minuses First:EXPENSIVE.  Everyone\'s comments were spot-on.  Everything\'s a la carte and pricier than the competition.  And if you want to take advantage of the flexibility of the travel system (car seat adapter) and a second seat, you have to go ahead and buy the second seat to get the second seat adapters.  So your upfront investment is large.BIG.  While it is an in-line tandem, the price you pay for it\'s flexibility is the fact that one kid is centered over the front wheels.  All the other inlines put both kids within the wheelbase of the stroller.  So while the overall length of the stroller in single position is about the same as all the others, with the second seat, that kid is out front making the stroller almost a foot longer than the stroller length.  Some of the comments we saw are that the stroller is hard to steer with the heavy kid up front.  That\'s definitely true given the fact that pure physics dictates that with the kid\'s weight out over the front wheels, it\'s hard to pivot.  It\'s definitely not a deal breaker.  Any stroller with two kids is going to be hard to pivot on a dime.  And the weight over the front wheels also makes it harder to pop a wheelie and get it over a curb.  Fortunately, we\'re two dads and we\'re both easily strong enough to do that.  You simply put your foot on the back axle and tilt the stroller up.Car Seat adapter.  Awful quality and design in stark contrast to something like the Bugaboo\'s travel system.  The Bugaboo is a simple drop in, click, and then click the car seat right in.  Because they are trying to be Universal, it isn\'t ideal for any single brand.  Our Graco Snugride fits and is safe, but it\'s wobbly.  Putting the adapter in place also works, but it\'s just not as simple as the Bugaboo\'s drop in.  It takes two hands, you have to align each side (right and left) and then put a strap over the top.  It feels like a cheap shortcut.Positives:QUALITY.  The stroller exudes quality.  It\'s polished, solid, and rolls smoothly over all surfaces.  It is easy to put together in &lt; 5 minutes, and you can take it apart equally fast for travel.  Everything snaps or clicks into place with a solid thunk.  Everything fits together well and there are no rattles.  The Quartz fabric feels durable and hides dirt well.  The aluminum and the canvas and the wheels are all of high quality and feel bullet-proof.  The price for the stroller itself is probably appropriate and commensurate to its competition.Configurations.  With two boys so close in age, we figured that there will be the inevitable fighting and kicking, but also hopefully peaceful and loving playtime.  So the big attraction of the BJCS was the ability to put them facing together when they\'re good.  Or we can put them facing apart or both forward on the rare occasion that they aren\'t the perfect little angels we expect them to be.  The other inlines have one kid sitting below and behind the other.  We didn\'t want one kid to always feel he was getting a second-class seat without a view.  We also saw that configuration as an invitation for one kid to kick the other.  At least that would be what I would have done to my sibling at that age.Cargo.  Because of the way this stroller puts the second kid out front instead of down and behind, the entire storage basket is available for use.  It\'s huge.  You can fit a large diaper bag, a big purse (auntie\'s, not the dads\'), and coats and sweaters from all the adults that are getting hot and sweaty pushing nearly 60 lbs. up a hill.  This basket holds everything you would want on a stroll or trip.  It\'s very useful for shopping trips and walking around all day because it carries so much and that you don\'t have to on your shoulders or back.OVERALL.  For our situation with two kids close in age, this stroller seemed ideal and it has lived up to its expectations.  It is not as maneuverable as our Bugaboo but it\'s head and shoulders better than a normal tandem.  It beats a side-by-side stroller for overall utility.  If your kids aren\'t going to be as close in age, the other inlines are going to be more maneuverable simply because all the weight is within the wheelbase of the stroller.  The downsides of those strollers are that you give up the storage basket and the one kid sits down and behind.",5

"512","Infantino Drop and Slide Fun Farm","I was unsure of how this toy would work out as I couldn\'t find any reviews, but I hoped it would encourage my daughter (11 months) to learn to put things in somewhere.What it does:  there are three holes on the top for the three balls to go through.  They can sit in the holes, but it only takes a light pressure to push them through - I\'d been worried by the description that you could hammer them in.  It\'s definitely easy enough for a young child.  When they go through the hole, it makes a noise, a different one for each.  One hole has a curving slide; the other two drop through the barn.Other functions:  there\'s a chicken on the front that can be turned around (no sound effects, just a clicking noise).  There\'s a sliding purple door that reveals a drawing of a pig.  There\'s a chicken sitting on three colored ""eggs"" that serves as a hammer.  And there\'s a button on the front that plays 9 seconds of music.The music and sounds are pretty good for a kids\' toy, the volume isn\'t too loud, it\'s a cute tune, and it doesn\'t drive me insane after hearing it for the 50th time in a row.Batteries are included, and you need a Phillips head screwdriver to remove the toy from the packaging.As for my daughter, she seems to enjoy it.  She learned to push the balls in, then to play the music, then to put the balls in the holes by herself, so it\'s done a pretty good job of encouraging her to develop these skills.  The sliding purple door and chicken that turns are not of interest to her, and we haven\'t introduced the hammer yet.  Overall, I\'m pleased, though for the price I\'d expected a bit more to do on it than push the balls in and listen to a short tune.Update:  at 13 months, this toy gets little play.  She prefers to take the balls and put them in another toy (the Playskool Busy Ball-Tivity Center).  I still think it\'s a cute toy, and will keep it for future children.",4

"518","Scootababy Essential Carrier, Charcoal","I have an Ergo carrier, a Moby wrap, a Snuggli carrier, a Playtex Hip Hammock and now the Scootababy Carrier. The Snuggli was a temporary use carrier as they aren\'t good for the hip/spine development of babies. I only used that one until my Ergo arrived. I love the Ergo, but to do a hip carry, it\'s a pain in the rear, and I can\'t seem to get out of it by myself without almost dropping my child. Love the Ergo for an infant, or an older child back carry, but the hip carry is not for me with this carrier. I loved the Moby wrap, but again, can\'t really do a hip/side carry with this one easily. The Playtex Hip Hammock was great for the hip, but sucks to wear with a heavier child, or for more than a few minutes. Both me and my toddler would become uncomfortable. I didn\'t like how it would put pressure on my neck/should area. It would actually cause me pain to wear it for more than a few minutes. I came across the Scootababy carrier, and loved how the carrier\'s fleece panel would cradle your shoulder versus automatically rest on your neck and/or top part of the shoulder. Once I recieved my carrier, I immiediately opened it up and put it on and put my toddler in it. Both myself and my (approximately 30 lb) toddler were very comfortable. I don\'t recommend this carrier for back carrying as it becomes awkward (Scootababy says it can be used for back carrying, and shows you how), or at least that was my experience. I have yet to try this as a front carrier, as both my toddler and I don\'t prefer that carry at this time.Bottom Line: If you\'re looking for a hip/side carrier for your child that is both comfortable to wear for short and long periods and you want their weight distributed and them not to be dangling by their crotch, this is an awesome carrier to buy. I will definitely be getting rid of my Playtex Hip Hammock now that I have this carrier. The Scootabably also folds up to a reasonable size to be kept in the car, or to grap on your way out.",NA

I use setting #3 for sanitizing my pacifiers, this setting gets the water smoking hot.  There is a light but it comes on to let you know that it\'s getting the water up to temp.  Watch the water level when placing the bottle in the warmer (volume displacement), other than that it\'s a breeze to use.

Fits her perfectly. Definitely not for big kids (like probably good for kids up to about 5 years old, but if they\'re tall, maybe not).It\'s lightweight, folds up like a camping chair and fits nicely into its little sack. She\'s slept comfortably on it a handful of times already and it\'s been great. The little fitted sheet that comes with it is nice because it\'s washable. The only thing that I don\'t love about it is that it\'s made of a similar nylon material as those folding camp chairs, so when she tosses and turns at night, you hear the ""swoosh, swoosh"" of the nylon. So if you\'re tent camping next to a little one that likes to toss and turn, you\'ll need to be a sound sleeper to ignore the sound (though many sleeping bags make the same swooshing noise too!)Overall, a great purchase and for the $[...] it cost, it was well worth it for camping while at home too.",4

"537","Chicco Liteway Stroller, Fuego","I\'ll admit it, I am a bit of a stroller snob.  I have high expectations for my strollers.  I typically use larger, jogging-type strollers with inflated wheels (Baby Jogger City Series, Zooper Zydeco, Bob, etc.) but I needed a lighter weight stroller to keep in my car and use for quick outings.  I ended up choosing the Chicco Liteway stroller and I have been really impressed.  Here are some of my favorite features:- This stroller has great maneuverability!  It is very easy to push and turn one-handed.  It makes life so much easier when you can hold something with one hand (like a toddler or preschooler\'s hand) and push the stroller with the other.- The recline is super!  It does not have one of those pull cord reclines that are so hard to use when the baby or toddler is lying back in the stroller.  It has a little latch on the back of the seat that you squeeze together and Presto! the seat can recline as much or little as you like.  The seat also folds all the way flat for tiny infants.- I know we are warned to never, ever, ever hang things from the handles.  But I think we all do it from time to time.  When hanging a bag or purse from the handle on this stroller it hangs right over the back wheels so it seems there is less chance it will cause the stroller to tip backward.- The design is snazzy.  We have the stroller in black and I really like the way it looks.  The other colors are also nicely designed, too.- It is fairly easy to fold and open, though it does take two hands.  I wasn\'t able to do it easily while holding the baby.There are a lot of other great features to this stroller.  I have been very pleasantly surprised at the quality and features given the price point.",5

The multiple extension options make it fit almost any size hallway!!2. The price (in my book) is perfect!3. To keep it in place (along w/ the pressure), you can use screws, the double sided tape or both for a stronger hold.4. The 3""+ play on each end is what really makes it fit almost anywhere5.

My son loves the musical settings, although the mobile is rather lame. I also really appreciated that the seat can be removed from the base. I often will take the seat out and put my son in it and set him in the bathroom while I take a shower. The speed settings don\'t really matter...it seems no matter what level I put it on, he still swings at the same speed. My son does not sleep in his swing, but it\'s nice to put him in it for 15 minutes so I can eat lunch or tidy up.

"552","Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","I\'m very happy with this gate. I liked it so much I bought a second one. It\'s very easy to open (if you know how to--visitors have a hard time with it). I don\'t think the bar at the bottom is a hazard at all. It does clang if you let it slam shut, but it\'s not a big deal to close it gently. If you let it slam all the time, it will eventually get a little out of alignment and won\'t close correctly, but it\'s very easy to fix, and if you use the optional wall mounts you won\'t have that problem at all. It\'s tall enough that my dogs can\'t jump over it, but I can still easily lift bulky things (like laundry) over it. The gate fits in my doorways without using the extensions.I bought this gate at Babies R Us, and it had been opened and returned and was missing the mounting caps and wrench.

"559","DaVinci Anastasia Crib","Well, I had a difficult time picking a crib as there aren\'t a lot of consumer reviews for some cribs and I needed to mail-order one due to the lack of a large car/SUV to take one home from the store.  I like the style of this crib and it arrived with nary a scratch on the finish, which seem remarkable to me as it is VERY easy to scratch.  In fact I made one trying to put it together on my own (seven months pregnant).  It took me approximately an hour and a half and most pieces fit together pretty well.  The drawer is a little flimsy and didn\'t align very well, but I managed to force it together.  I knew from some other reviews that this drawer is notoriously flimsy and not a good place to store anything heavier than some sheets or a pacifier, so I\'m not relying on this for storage.  The mattress support is metal and has 3 positions.  You will need a crib skirt because at the highest level the mattress  has a gap above the drawer that looks funny without a crib skirt.  Overall it seems fairly sturdy. There is some exposed attachments where the bolts go in which are tightened by an allen wrench.  I know it won\'t last long without scratching and I had to take the door off the hinges in my house to get it in the nursery because I assembled it in the living room where I had more room.  Overall, I\'m fairly happy with the purchase, especially as I tried a Sorelle crib before this that I\'m still trying to return that sent me two left sides instead of a left and a right and they were very hesitant to let me return it.  Two months later the remains of the crib is still sitting on my porch.  At least this company sent me all the right parts and it looks pretty good.",4
"560","Fisher-Price Zen Collection Cradle Swing","The product was easy to assemble, took my husband and I maybe about 40 minutes to put it together (that was while watching tv as well). I am pretty disappointed with the shipping aspect - this did arrive with with dings and scratches on the legs and scuff marks where the swing is held in place. I do like the swinging motion and the noises. I cannot wait to get my little boy in this. I would just be prepared for scratches on your item. I won\'t return it just because its not worth the hassle of putting it back in the box and shipping it back.",3

"574","RECARO Performance RIDE Convertible Car Seats, Vibe","I bought this after reading the many positive reviews, but it just didn\'t work for us. My husband and I spent about two hours trying to install it rear-facing in my car (a Ford Fiesta). One problem was that we couldn\'t tighten the LATCH attachments sufficiently (they seemed to get stuck), and when we tried installing it with a seatbelt it still slid around. We wedged a rolled up towel underneath to try to get it level (according to the manual\'s instructions) and then it looked secure; however, I drove around a corner and the seat tipped over. At that point, I decided I would just return it.I am still giving the seat three stars because the harness and headrest are very easy to adjust and our son seemed comfortable in the seat when we strapped him into it in our living room. The issue might be largely one of compatibility between the seat and the car. We ended up buying and keeping the Chicco NextFit, which I was able to install securely in five minutes and which is adaptable to a wider range of vehicles than the Performance Ride due to its adjustable recline. The RECARO Performance Ride might be great for many vehicles, but I wouldn\'t recommend it for the Ford Fiesta or similar cars.",3

Give this to a hungry child and you will have one unhappy kid on your hands!  We have several other cups from different manufacturers and we like this one the least.

They are the perfect size and absorb spit ups very well. Other burp cloths, the puke will roll right off and onto the floor, couch, or you. They hold up thru washings very well, but make sure to wash them in HOT water by themselves a few times before you launder them with your regular loads (to get rid of excess dye).

I bought this as a second stroller post not wanting to be in the baby seat and not always using the bulky double stroller when the 4yo wasn\'t with me.

The bad rewiews I read are from people who don\'t use commom sense. To set up your camera - have the monitor in the room with you so you can see what the camera is seeing- then take it to where you want to view your baby. You don\'t have to go back and forth 100 times. The reception is clear-- if it isn\'t -- change the channel. If there is feedback from the speaker- the volume is too high. The many problems people have are easily solved if you use your brain. I can\'t believe this monitor isn\'t reviewed at 5 stars across the board.

My box still closes nicely but I do not run it through the dishwasher often due to the potential warping.  Only run through the dishwasher on the top rack if you do.  You can fit a pretty big meal in here.  Usually more than my son can eat, and he eats a lot.  You can fit a juice box in it along with plenty of food.

"612","Stokke Tripp Trapp Highchair, Red","Overall, it\'s a nice high chair with a cute design.  However, the harness is pretty terrible.  I can\'t adjust it small enough to fit my daughter well, but more importantly, I can barely unclasp the plastic clasp of the harness.  Sometimes I ask my partner to do it for me (and I can unclasp other plastic clasps without a problem, like on our baby carrier).  If you have arthritis or postpartum joint pain, I don\'t think you would be able to use the clasp at all.Secondly, they advertise that you can use the high chair into childhood (and even into adulthood!) -- I don\'t see how it would last that long.  I have had it for 2 months and the black paint is already scuffing off of the high chair.  I am not as impressed with the quality as I hoped I would be for the price.",3

I can take a shower or even eat a meal and she will occupy herself very contentedly.I smelled the panda side and we have no problem there.  I can only find the smell if I hunt for it, and it\'s a very mild green apple scent.  That is her favorite part, I guess she finds the crinkling quite tasty in her mouth.The cube is not machine washable like the inchworm, but we have done sink washings and it dries like new.When offered a choice she goes for this toy the most.

I would not recommend for a baby under 5 or 6 months as it only really holds your baby by the hips.For longer trips I recommend the Beco Butterfly 2 or a long non stretch wrap.  For newborns I would recommend a sling type carrier.When I purchased this my daughter was no longer happy to sit quietly in a sling type carrier and had become SO active it really wasn\'t safe.  I read what other reviewers said about the neck discomfort and I think that would be a real issue for long trips.  I tend to find myself pushing the shoulder strap to the side.",4

"618","Baby Trend Diaper Champ in Blue","The basic idea may be good but after 4 days I am ready to hurl this piece of junk out a window. Even when it worked ""right"" it was a pain because it is so cheaply made that it is very top-heavy. When you try to swing the lever to drop the diaper you have to stand firmly on the tiny foot braces with both feet, or the whole thing just falls over. That\'s mainly because the door thing doesn\'t work smoothly at the best of times, and now 4 days into it the seal ring is coming off and getting in the way making it nearly impossible to work. Add to that the fact that wipes, etc. are getting stuck and coming back out.The only good thing about this product is that unlike most of the others it uses standard garbage bags. I wish it cost twice as much and was twice as well constructed -- if it worked right it would be well worth it -- but as it is it\'s a waste of money.Especially if you\'re a new parent with your first child please believe the negative reviews and avoid this thing. The last thing you need with a new baby is to be stressed and angry over a stupid diaper pail.",1

"628","Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz","My 15 month old will only drink from straw cups and we\'ve tried Playtex, Vita Baby, Take n Toss and Zoli.  The Zoli are my favorite easily for a couple reasons.  They don\'t leak, they are easy to drink from, the weighted straw is awesome and my daughter loves them.  I occasionally do have an issue with milk coming out of the straw but if you know how positive pressure works, this is a problem for all straw cups that are ""leak proof"".  It\'s science and there\'s really nothing you can do about it.  These cups leak the least though which I appreciate.  The Vita baby ones were terrible with liquid coming out the straw and the Playtex were also pretty bad.I have experienced what some people were saying about the cups bring hard to thread right but what I do is this.  Fill the cup and set the top on, then twist it the opposite direction until it drops down then twist it the right direction to tighten.  This ensures that the threads set correctly.  I also don\'t have a problem with the durability of this cup.  My daughter throws it all the time and ours it still in great shape.  I have the Oxo bottle cleaning set and that works great for cleaning this cup.  To remove the straw, I pull it out with a paper towel over my fingers which works easily.  These cups aren\'t perfect but I think they are the best leak proof option available.  Worth every penny.Update - a few months later and all my Zoli cups are leaking BAD.  I think they need a new silicone ring inside.  I emailed customer service but I have to take pictures of each cup and send them all the receipts.  I will probably call and just see if they will send me new silicone rings... they are small and cheap so I hope I don\'t get a run around about it.

"632","Jeep Universal Cruiser Car Seat Carrier","Got this the other day. Decided to go ahead and try it even though it isn\'t supposed to work with Chicco car seats. Works fine with mine. I noticed some reviewers didn\'t feel it was secure but I think its very sturdy. I don\'t even use the strap. Of course if the stroller tips over the car seat will come out but the strollers that come with the travel systems have the same problem.The basket underneath is HUGE and there is lots of other storage. Its easy to get out of the car and set up with one hand. Its probably a little bigger folded than some of the simpler snap n gos but all the storage makes it worth it. Super easy to push and turns on a dime. Love love love it. I wish they would make a ""big boy"" seat that you could snap in when taking the car seat is no longer necessary. I guess they want you to buy another stroller.",5
"633","Gerber Graduates BPA Free 2 Pack Scoopin Spoon, Colors May Vary","We really liked these spoons because of the soft rubber and the depth of the spoon which holds more than most spoons.  We have 4 of them.  But recently we noticed that there are specs of oil on the spoon even though we hand-washed them.  For quite some time, I thought maybe we just weren\'t washing them well enough, and just rewashed them and dried them just before using.  But after a number of weeks, I decided it just couldn\'t be... I wash them thoroughly at night, and the next morning I find that there is oil on them.  I thought perhaps it was some chemical reaction with the plastic cup that we were standing them up in overnight.  So I finally decided to keep them overnight on a paper towel.  Well, by lunch time next day, there is an oily film on the soft rubber part.... not on the handle but only on the spoon sccop.  If I leave it sitting there longer, I can see small droplets of oil forming on the surface of the scoop.So now I know that there is some kind of oil in the rubber to make it soft and pliable, and after some use it starts to ooze out.  I wonder if this oil could be toxic.  I regret it because I really like the shape and function of these spoons, but I have stopped using these spoons for fear of this oozing oil.",NA

My 4.7 year-old fits very comfortably and broke it in on a 6 hour road trip (in more ways than one....the seat covers have already been removed (easily) and washed).  Loving the cup holders - never knew how much I loved them until we had one without them.  Lots of nice padding, love the safety features and the latch system.

While the price was right on this and the wt range allowed for years of use, I ended up using this as a secondary seat for my husband\'s car (which my son does not ride in often) and spending the extra money on a Britax.  This seat IS lighter than some others but it is all plastic and flimsy feeling.  I never had it rear facing and it fit fine in my Saturn Vue front-facing. I found the LATCH buckles to be tricky and hard to adjust on this seat also.  My son was also uncomfortable in this carseat.  EVERY time he fell asleep his head fell out of the headrest... so much for side impact protection!  I ended up with a Britax marathon 70 and am much happier with that.",2

"644","KidCo Safeway Safety Gate, White","Decent value - but it is nowhere near as easy to install as it claims to be. I am pretty handy, and it took me at least a couple hours. Plus, even with using their template provided, not everything lines up as perfect as they make it seem like it should. The top can be pulled all the way out if someone tried which makes me nervous.Also it\'s worth mentioning that I had multiple screws break the heads right off in my oak wood stair banister. I pre-drilled starter holes as instructed, and as I knew needed to be done, but the heads just snapped right off. I had to re-drill a few holes which certainly didn\'t help with the alignment issues I was already having, and I know my banister will look like crap once I\'m ready to remove this gate in a couple years.Between the alignment problems, cheap quality screws, being able to pull the top hinge right out, and the fact that the &#34;locking&#34; mechanism isn\'t all that great - I am very disappointed in a product that was supposed to be easy to install and ensure the safety of my children. Wish I would have paid an extra $10 or $20 to get something better.",2

The The next year at Christmas he had it with him and his parents raved about how it was the best toy they every received!  I purchased a few more for friends an they said the same.One of these friends purchased one for me when I had a baby and it has truly been a life saver.  This can occupy a baby when nothing else can.  We make sure we bring it with us for every outing.  It\'s great to have in the car and has saved us in stores and restaurants a number of times.We started using it when our daughter was a few weeks old and we still use it now that she i 6 months old.  She could be screaming crying and I pull this out and she immediately stops crying and stares at the lights and listens to the music. The songs are not annoying and it has 2 volume settings.  It also has an off switch so it doesn\'t turn on in your diaper bag/etc.  We have yet to replace the battery and it has been used daily for 6 months.I just can\'t express how great this toy is!  Definitely a life saver!",5
"649","Jolly Jumper Bumper Bonnet Toddler Head Cushion","This saved our little guy and us a lot of headaches! My son starting cruising at 7 months, and between his extra large head and our hardwood floors, we had several scary bumps in the first couple weeks (in addition to the countless little ones). Then, we got this ""helmet"". We only really put it on him when he was being extra adventurous or when he\'d get tired and sloppy since those were the times that he tended to hit the ground harder, and we only really used it for about a month until he got a bit steadier on his feet. However, it made all the difference for that month! He usually didn\'t mind wearing it, though we did have to pin the cross sections to shorten them a little so that it wouldn\'t fall over his eyes all the time. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an early and/or clumsy walker and hard flooring.",5

"653","Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We have been using our turtle for a little over a year now. Our turtle has been part of our nightly routine (and sometimes naptime), every night since purchase, and I have only changed the batteries once. Our son is almost two years old and he loves seeing the stars on his ceiling at night. He began noticing, and becoming super interested in, the real stars in the night sky around a year ago. So bedtime is just a little more exciting when we can tell our child to &#34;go turn on your stars.&#34; Clearly, the shell is hard plastic so this is more of a stationary \'toy\'. Don\'t expect much cuddling with your turtle. The nightlight does turn off after a certain amount of time, but that does save battery life. There is no option to keep it on all night. However, if your child is a little older, it is very easy to operate if they want to turn it back on. We have had no problem with visibility of the stars and they project onto our standard-height ceiling just fine. I\'m very happy with this purchase and foresee our turtle being part of the family for a very long time.",5

"658","UPPAbaby Stroller Parent Organizer, Black","I am so glad I bought this organizer last year despite the negative reviews at the time.  I am glad to see that the reviews have gotten better.  This was one of my best baby purchases.  I have been using my organizer for almost a year now and it is great!  I don\'t have any issues with it sagging, and I have actually put a Big Gulp in the cup holder once or twice =).  Probably not intended for that on a daily basis though!  The velcro is very strong.  I\'ve had no issues with it bumping off.  On occasion I re-adjust it to make it tighter, but that is not a big deal.  I find that you can recline the seat in the forward facing position, it might take a little shimmy-ing, but I\'ve never had to take the organizer off or remove my items. Overall this is so handy for a credit card, cell phone, house keys, soda/snack cup/baby bottle, spare change, parking garage validations/tickets (they don\'t get lost anymore!), pacifiers, and other small baby toys.  And I love that it is in a convenient spot and so accessible to the driver.  Material is great.  It does not show dirt, it is water resistant, and wipes clean with ease.  Great purchase!",5

"660","Smart Mom Teething Bling Donut Shaped Necklace - Turquoise","I originally purchased a different brand of teething jewelry by accident. That necklace was awful (the sting was cheap and so short that my baby could not play with it, not to mention there wasn\'t a clasp). ""Smart Mom Teething Bling"" is a GREAT product! I was given the turquoise one as a gift. I love it! The brilliant blue color is beautiful. The silk ribbon is smooth, soft, durable and just long enough for baby to have fun. Smart Mom necklaces come with a breakaway cord for safety measures and it has a clasp which I love! I\'ve had my necklace a few days and have gotten compliments left & right! People do not know it is for the baby since it is so stylish BUT my baby knows it is for her! She just turned 7 months and she loves to play & chew on it. I think she likes to drop and pick it up the most! I wish I would have had this months ago when the whole teething thing started! Also, I have to say, their customer service is phenomenal! I had some questions about their product so I contacted the company...I received an immediate response. Their service was above and beyond what anyone could expect.",5

"667","BRICA Baby In-Sight Magical Firefly Auto Mirror for in Car Safety","I was given the product to review and we loved it.  My 5 and half month old loves this mirror.  She loves to look at herself and smile.  I used it in our house before I even put it in the car and she just loves it.  My only complaint for keeping it in the car is that you have to remember to put the mirror on when you put the baby in the car because the remote only controls the volume and the kind of music you want to play.  I love that it has volume control because we have another brica mirror (we got the grey one at our baby shower) in our other car and it does not have a volume control (but the plus side of the grey brica mirror is that you can turn on the music or light with the remote) which is helpful.  I feel like my daughter doesn\'t cry as much because she has someone to look at or listens to the music.  Overall, I think both brica mirrors are helpful in the car.",5

"684","Britax B-Safe Infant Car Seat, Black","I received the B-Safe from the Vine AFTER already purchasing the Chaperone to use with the B-Agile I also purchased (although some super lucky Viners did receive them through the program!)  I digress...Here\'s a major misconception clear up - the B-Safe is NOT lighter or smaller *or minimally so* then the Chaperone.  No joke.  I was so looking forward to having a second seat, that fit in my B-Agile, that would be light since the Chaperone is really heavy.  WRONG.Second major complaint and why I DO NOT recommend the B-Safe over the Chaperone:  The canopy is squared.The B-Agile Stroller was released the same time as the B-Safe, they were released together and implied to be made as the ""lighter, cheaper"" solution to say the B-Ready/Chaperone combo.  Here\'s the thing.  The B-Agile has a ROUNDED canopy, as does the Chaperone.  This means when you pull them together you can create a totally covered canopy.  This is AWESOME.  It allows my daughter to nap peacefully protected from the rain, sun, wind, snow whatever.  The B-Safe however, has a SQUARED canopy (that happens to be much smaller btw).  This means no matter what way you pull them together there will always be huge gaps between the canopies. Not useful in anything but sun for shade.This drives me insane. Why would Britax do that?  It makes NO sense!The fabric on the Chaperone is way better too, the B-Safe feels kind of cheap.The base of the B-Safe is significantly smaller so I guess that is a major plus.  We use the Chaperone in a Chrysler 300 and it fits fine, but I\'m petite and don\'t mind having the seat really far forward.Chaperone for the win since the only real plus about the B-Safe is that it has a smaller base.However, keep in mind the Chaperone is really easy to install and use WITHOUT the base so if you can\'t fit it in your car - consider nixing it.",2

I tried several other child guards but it required drilling, screwing and size issues and lots of other constraints. I wanted something that was pretty simple to install.This product was very easy to install, just stick on either doors of the cabinet and voila.....I would recommend this product to all the moms out there who wants to install a child guard for cabinets without needing the complicated installation issues.",5

He is 29 inches long and weighs 21 pounds.  I ordered the medium and according to the company\'s sizing it should fit him perfectly.  It doesn\'t .  The arm and head holes are so big that it can bunch up around his face - defeating the purpose of a sleep sack, right?A quick and easy fix for this company would be to add another set of buttons to the shoulder straps.  It would solve my problem by helping the arm holes to fit snugly.  I\'ll keep it for when he\'s bigger, but wish that their sizing information was correct.

"699","Thinkativity Imagine and Learn Musical Mixer","We were very excited about this toy - a relative who is a chef gave it to my 2 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas 2009. The toy seemed to work, in that it responds when the child puts the different pieces in the mixer. However after hearing my child get lots of ""try again"" type responses, I tried it myself. It didn\'t work as intended. The toy doesn\'t recognize the pieces/foods well. A third of the time it doesn\'t ""see"" a piece at all, a third of the time it thinks it\'s a different food, and a third of the time it correctly ""sees"" the food. Because of this, it is impossible to play the game of making certain foods by mixing and matching the pieces.It was also difficult to tell if you were pushing the pieces in properly - sometimes it would respond just to lightly push them into the spot, other times you\'d have to push hard until it clicked in. How the item was pushed in did not improve the toy\'s accuracy at ""seeing"" the foods.I would have given this one star, but since I didn\'t follow up with the manufacturer, I will give it a little benefit of the doubt that we just had a defective toy.",2
"700","Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair","As a first-time parent, I wanted a high chair that was easy to use and was something my 6-month-old could grow into. The tray easily detaches for washing (either by hand or in the dishwasher).  The tray does take up a lot of space in the dishwasher, so I typically wash with soapy water unless things get really messy. This high chair was also good because it doesn\'t take up a ton of space in our small dining room.  So far, the little guy loves it!  I wish I could say the same thing about some of the baby foods he\'s tried....",5
"701","Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","We purchased this when our son was 2 months old.  He still sleeps in his bassinet so we mainly got this for naps during the day in his crib.  We thought it might help him go to sleep since he already fights us when we try to get him to take a nap.  Instead of making him drowsy he gets really excited and coos and laughes at the toys.  He is now 3 months and still gets really excited when we put him under the mobile.  I\'m really happy with that even, because I can get a few things done around the house while he\'s entertained by it.  So overall, we are very happy with the product.  Also, several reviews complained about the volume of the music and sounds.  It\'s just loud enough, especially with baby only being a foot from the speaker.  Great product!",5

"706","BubbleBum Inflatable Car Booster Seat","I purchased this booster seat to use in a rental car while driving. I chose it because of the good reviews and because I liked the idea: an inflatable and compact booster. I also liked that it comes with a strap adjuster.First the positives: yes, it is compact and very easy to inflate/deflate.However, the booster does not stay in place. My son is not an overly active child but yes, he did move while sitting and the booster seat moved/slid with him! I had to readjust the seat and the belts as much as I could, but I could easily tell that the booster seat did not provide proper protection at all... And yes, I am sure I installed it according to the directions.So I would say, you can use this only for very short trips, maybe half an hour or less, and with a child that does not move at all! Even then, I would just choose a regular nicer booster.As for us, I chose to rent a booster seat with the rental car on the trip back and my son was much more comfortable in it... and I will look to see if I can return this!",2

"708","Valco Baby 2011 Tri-mode SE Single in Cirque","I purchased both Tri Mode and Latitude EX from Amazon because I couldn\'t decide which one fits better for me.At that time (April 2011), the descriptions on the Valco Baby (VB) web site was not clear (what included in the box, differences among all models, etc) and no stores had store models on site.I wish VB makes a detailed comparison chart like Baby Jogger.I wanted to keep Latitude, but I had to RETURN BOTH strollers for the following reasons:Tri Mode has very nice functions and design, but it is too bulky and too heavy.  I live in a city, so Tri Mode does not work for me.PROS Tri Mode- Has nice fabric- Has seat pad, head support, strap cover included- has front bar included- Nice blushed nickel finish frame- Extended canopy with a zipper is huge plus- Recline almost 180 degree is big plus- Upright almost 90 degree is big plus- Has included rain cover- Has snack tray option availableCONS Tri Mode- Too heavy 23 LB- Too bulky overall- The rear tires are positioned too wide- No foot rest adjustment- Too many steps to fold- No need to have a bag on the rear canopy - nice to have mesh window though- No need to have side pockets on the basket- No need to have a zipper on the basket - it is useless.... rather have a larger, lower & load function like Graco- Canopy opening and closing make big noize.  Why?- No parent console.  I would like to have a console, not a cup holder which is very flimsy.PROS Latitude- 19 LB light weight (if it\'s around 17 LB, even better)- Narrow rear tire positioning, so I can manage narrow streets or door ways- Extended canopy with a zipper is huge plus- Recline almost 180 degree is big plus- Upright almost 90 degree is big plus- Has adjustable foot rest- Medium sized basket and easy access (if it\'s larger and lower & load function like Graco, it is perfect.)- Has included rain cover- Stand upright when foldedCONS Latitude- Does NOT INCLUDED a front bar and car seat adapter (they\'re included in the box until 2010 model, but being redesigning right now, and they\'re not included in 2011 model) Those are NOT available even in the option.- Does not available snack tray option for Latutude.  Almost all parents want it, so please make one.  Personally, I don\'t need a boots cover, so including a snack tray is more valuable.- Shiny aluminum frame is cheap looking.  If it is non shiny color (blushed nickel color) like Tri Mode, it is much better looking.- I would love to have ALL black color like Tri Mode (I don\'t like the striped silver stitches on Latitude Ricorice - it is not cute.), so that I can coordinate better with another seat pad which I was planning to order additionally.- Easier folding system than Tri Mode, but it\'s still complicated.  I want ONE STEP FOLD like other brands.- Canopy opening and closing make big noize.  Why?- Canopy doesn\'t have mesh window for air circulation- No parent console.  I would like to have a console, not a cup holder which is very flimsy.- No seat pad and strap covers are included. (I would like to have matching seat pad and strap covers.)- No need to have a little flip on the top of the back seat.  It is always bended down.  What\'s this for?- Should have same nice fabric like Tri ModePROS Seat Pad- Has velcro, so easy put on/off- Nice paddingCONS  Seat Pad- Need more design/color variety- Should include strap covers in the packageIn conclusion, I would like to have Tri Mode quality Latitude but much smaller/lighter stroller.  I would like to purchase Latitude when the front bar is available.  Hopefully in 2012 model.",NA

Pros: it serves as a nightlight when you need to enter their rooms at night, 3 soothing sounds to choose from, converts to a toddler sleep soother when they are too old for mobile attachment, remote.  It has been especially great for tricky toddler sleep; when my daughter wakes up at night, she turns it on and goes right back to sleep.

"721","Delta Universal 6 Drawer Dresser, Black Cherry","I spent weeks trying to find a crib/dresser matching set that I liked. I wanted to purchase a dresser that could also be used as a changing table. Changing tables seem like such a waste of money since you only want to use them while your child is little. With this dresser I can put a changing pad on top and then my child can use it as a dresser until she leaves home!I purchased the dresser in the cherry espresso color and loved it! It still has the dark color of espresso with a tint of red. I think it is gorgeous! I also purchased the ""Delta Canton 4 in 1 Crib"" in Cherry EspressoDelta Canton 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, Espresso Cherry. I was worried that since the drawer was called ""Delta Eclipse"" in Cherry Espresso that the colors may not match but they matched perfectly! I would highly recommend the crib as well.I was a little worried about the size of the dresser because I couldn\'t find the dimensions but it is the perfect size for my baby\'s room! It is 48 1/2 inches wide, 20 1/4 inches deep, and 34 1/2 inches tall. Perfect size for a changing table on top plus a basket or small lamp or something at the other end.The six drawers are of good size as well. They are 20 1/2 inches wide and 6 1/2 inches deep. They slide open easily and don\'t shut too quickly for fingers to get caught in them.My father and husband put the dresser together and they thought it was fairly easy to put together if you just follow the instructions. Everything they needed to put it together was included. The only thing they added was at their own decision. They decided to use glue on all the joints to make it even stronger so the dresser will last even longer. (If you do this be sure to not use too much glue. Be sure to wipe away any access glue.)My father would be considered a very handy man. He has put together several dressers and other items in his day. He said that this was one of the sturdiest dressers he had put together in a long time and that the materials were very high quality. He and I are very confident that the dresser will last for a long time.Overall, this is an excellent dresser! If you are a parent, that is looking to purchase a dresser for your child that is both beautiful and not over priced this is the dresser for you! It looks just as nice if not nicer than the $500 dressers I was looking at in the store and I got this dresser for only $200. A great price for an item that appears it will last for years to come! I love that it matched the crib I purchased for $200 as well. So I got a great set that looks amazing for a combined price of what I would have had to pay in a fancy store for one of them.",5

I\'m 6\'6"" and my wife is 5\'9"" and I don\'t think there can ever be enough reviews from the folks a few extra standard deviations from the mean.  The key features of this product that tipped the scales for us are as follows:(1) Adjustable Handle: Required for tall parents.  This prevents us form having to stoop over to actually hold on to the stroller, which, seeing as a baby is going to be riding in it, is on the important side.  It\'d be terrific if they made the handle extend out even further, but hey, it\'ll probably work just fine for most folks in our height bucket.(2) Back Wheels: Well-placed, meaning, I don\'t kick the bottom when my stride extends out too far.(3) Bassinet: One less thing to think about purchasing.  Love the fact that it can be swapped between a fixed piece of furniture and the stroller.We also looked at the City Elite, which I think is amazing in terms of the ease of folding.  However, the ease of assembly coupled with the other features seemed to tip the scales for us.",NA

It was east to setup and is extremely sturdy. The door in the gate has a small opening. It is about 18inchs. I think it should be wider. I have not used this gate as a pen or attached it to the wall. I do like the flexibility of it being able to swing on one hinge if required or used as a pen. I removed one of the panels since I did not need all of them and it was easy to remove and reconfigure the gate. I have it spanning a 122inch opening and it is sitting like a half octagon, so it is self supporting and very stable. The installation hardware appears to be very good quality and easy to install. I am not giving the product four five stars since the gate in the door should be have a wider opening.

"750","Baby sleeping bag &quot;Minky Dot&quot; rose, quilted and double layered, 2.5 Togs (Large (22 mos - 3T))","I have been a sleep sack fan for many years, mainly because I\'m a mom who is very worried about SIDS. So when I discovered this bag, I had to give it a try. I wanted my little one to be warm during the winter nights, and this bag is more like a light comforter than the Halo sleep sacks (which would be great for the summer). I personally like Velboa, but am more appreciative of the fact that these bags have 100% cotton lining within. It holds up very well to multiple wears and washes. It is not stiff, and my baby loves to touch the soft velboa outer fabric. I also like that the sleeve holes can be buttoned up so it\'s not too roomy for a smaller baby\'s arm, but can be kept open when she grows bigger. The zippers are easy to deal with, and allows me to change my baby in the complete dark for sleep training. One wish is that the sack is a little longer - My little girl turned 4 months and she is already 25&#34; long and is 16 lbs... the small is for babies up to 27&#34; and 22 lbs. I don\'t think she\'ll make it to the medium size in weight by the time she\'s outgrown the small by the height. Well, every baby is different. It\'s no big deal anyway, because during this transition period, I\'ll have her back in the lighter Halo sleep sacks for the summer, and she\'ll fit into the medium size Minky Dot bag next winter.",NA
"751","Stork Craft Portofino 4-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib and Changer, Espresso","This being the first crib I\'ve ever bought, since this is my first child, I was super excited.  I wanted to make sure she would be able to use it for longer than just being a baby, which is why we went with a convertible style crib/bed.  I ordered the crib after my baby shower to ensure no family bought us one.  The price was fairly in range of all the other crib with changer models.  Once ordered, I got the your crib has been shipped email from Amazon.  Being as excited as I was, I checked on the tracking.  I\'ve cut back at work, and wanted to make sure I was at our home when the package arrived that way it wouldn\'t sit outside on the porch until after dark.  Unfortunately, I never got to track it.  Every time I clicked on the &#34;Track Package&#34; button, I got that it was unavailable and not able to retrieve the information.  It gave me a tracking date estimate of about 5 days, but I was worried since I couldn\'t track it.  I got a phone call from my mother in law that when she drove past our house, there was a rather large package on the porch.  Once my husband and I got home, he pulled it inside (Future Mama\'s, I would not recommend you pull the package in...it is VERY heavy, have the delivery driver or your husband do it!) The package wasn\'t too beat up, which is another reason I like to be home when I get expensive/large deliveries, I like to check for damage.  One of the first things my husband made a comment on was that the box looked like it had been opened previously.  Once we started taking the pieces out, a couple of the parts were not wrapped in the plastic like the rest were.  And some even had scuffs on them, like someone had taken them out and looked at them or even tried to put the crib together, but decided they didn\'t like it.  Most of the pieces looked great.  And there weren\'t major damages on any of the pieces.  The instructions were kind of crummy.  It took about 2 hours for us to put it together.  He did most of the work, I just held pieces together so he could screw them in.  The Allan Wrench didn\'t fit the screws all that fabulously, but it is what it is.  Everything got put together and it seems sturdy.  The changing pad I got from Babies R Us, doesn\'t fit the changing table, (the pad is too long) but it comes with a pad that fits.  Overall, I\'m pretty happy with it!",4

"756","Britax B-Safe Infant Car Seat, Black","Okay first off I really do like britax for its sturdy designs , convenience for parents and comfort and safety for kids.This carseat speaks exactly that of britax.The reason I picked this up on vine is I just purchased a B ready with second seat in the free ride event and this was just what I needed.I have a britax boulevard for my toddler in one car and a Sunshine Radian in the other.I am positive I can only use the Bsafe in the car with the Sunshine. 2 britax seats in one car...impossible in my midsize sedans.Yes This car seat though claiming to be lightweight is not the lightest of them but lighter than most out there.Also its nice and compact considering this is a britax.That said its really luxurious and safe and keeps the baby well cushioned.There is nice recline feature for babies to sleep or be propped up which is great.The 5 point harness is a must and is easy to click and get baby in and out of the car seat.It easily goes from my car to the B-ready stroller in one easy click.Its a definite plus that in the cold weather I wont have to juggle with fitting it on the stroller.Has a nice large size canopy perfect for the cold or sun.Easy carry handle.Easy to clean.And my baby can sleep well ...like a baby in this.I know that with this my baby is safe and comfotable.Easy to adjust harness.30 pound weight limit is way better than 22.Almost perfect.",5

"758","Spectra Dew 350 Advanced Double Electric Hospital Grade Breast Pump with Tote!","This is my new favorite breast pump. Why? PURE efficiency. I\'ve exclusively breastfed three babies. My third baby is now 4 months old. I store and use this pump in the new mothers room at work. It\'s so efficient that I can run up to the moms room during a 15 min break (pumping session only 10 min) and express the same amount of milk that would otherwise take over 20 min to express. It\'s easy to clean, simple design, and quietness are just an extra bonus. Pumping is much less stressful and less of an ordeal now that I have the Spectra Dew 350. I highly recommend this pump to anyone who is looking for an efficient pump and/or trying to boost your milk supply. Returning to work can be so taxing when you are trying to exclusively breastfeed your lil one and with this pump I\'ve found so much more peace of mind. I work 40+ hours in an office and pumping milk for my baby is essential. If I didn\'t have the Spectra Dew 350 I wouldn\'t even know what I was missing, but now that I am using it - there\'s no looking back to other pumps I\'ve purchased. I would even say life changing. My Lactation Consultant was even blown away and impressed.Pros:SUPER Efficient!!Quiet - whisper softSimple design - setting up for a pump session a breeze- attached power cord = one less step- turn it on and adjust dial, simpleDouble or Single electricBackflow preventionBargain - for the price, this pump seems too good to be trueCons:Less portable than some pumps (however smaller than the Lactina)No battery power option -- that said: hands down after using this pump for one month, I prefer this one over a more portable pump any day of the weekHappy Pumping!I use mine withSimple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS/S/M",NA

It fits my newborn well and I hope it will fit for another month or two. There are 2 downsides: First, there is a little too much fabric so that it can get unwieldy when changing his diaper. Even though the zipper unzips from the bottom supposedly for easier diaper changing, it is not easy because there is so much fabric that it\'s hard to get the new diaper underneath the baby. I end up having to take off the whole sleepsack anyway. Second, the fabric can be too thick/warm. I would get the cotton version next time and dress the baby in layers if necessary.",3

We\'ve only ever moved a sticker once or twice, so I\'m not sure how many times you can move them and reapply them and still have them stick. They remind me of those stickers that you can buy to place on your windows or mirrors, the type that you can apply and then peel right off when you\'re done displaying them.

"771","Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim","I am the the mother of a 14 week old who has reflux and is uncomfortable sleeping in a crib or anywhere flat. She wants to be held *all* the time, and it was getting pretty exhausting in our arms (and my chronic tendonitis was flaring up) until we ordered the sling after reading about it in Dr. Sears\'s The Baby Book.  I had my doubts, but boy has it been a lifesaver!The sling has been invaluable for me, my husband, and our regular sitter. With it, we are able to walk, bounce, give the calming pinky finger treatment, and see what\'s going on with the baby. She started using the sling at 2 weeks, when she was about 7 pounds. It took a few times, but she is now completely comfortable in it and it is a favorite napping spot.As I am large-breasted, I did find it awkward to breastfeed in it, although I\'ve been able to do it successfully a couple of times in public sitting down.  The fabric is soft and easily washable (important for those baby mishaps).  The padding helps me feel comfortable as a bit of protection in case of bumping.  The size is very adjustable for different height people, although you may need to pull through a lot of fabric to bring small babies in tightly, especially if you have a smaller chest size.The NoJo sling would benefit from having some loose fabric at the end to cover the baby\'s head in the sun and provide more coverage during breastfeeding. The stopper piece of plastic at the end of the fabric adds safety (it won\'t pull through), however it can whack the baby if you aren\'t careful when getting it on or off.  It could also use a zippered storage area, a feature of some other slings.  Also, the blue with plaid seems to be the only fabric sold these days, although I have seen other patterns and colors on eBay.  This is fine with jeans, but not great when you have to go to a wedding, as I did with the sling earlier this summer. I think it also makes people think that she\'s a boy, for some reason.  Maybe it\'s the blue and the fact that they can\'t see her cute dresses!The sling is also helpful in keeping interested strangers at a slight distance away from the baby -- they are less able to grab at her, which I think is good from a germ perspective, especially for newborns. When it is very hot or humid out, this sling can be a bit heavy for the baby (especially up against a hot mama!), but on cooler days the fabric adds just the right amount of warmth, like a light blanket.When I was pregnant, I assumed the Baby Bjorn would be all we would need. Instead it hangs on a hook most of the time unless we\'re going for a long walk or shopping -- activities where having two hands is important and you\'ll be doing them for a while. That thing is so hard to get on and off! Plus, you aren\'t supposed to use it until they are 8 lbs. The baby seems to really like the flexibility of positioning with the sling -- especially curling up happily in a womb-like ball -- and sometimes gets irritated by being all dangled out in the Bjorn.Carrying the baby in the sling makes you so much more mobile than using a stroller or lugging her around in her heavy carseat, so I use it whenever I anticipate being in public where they are stairs, space issues, or other impediments.  It\'s good for short shopping trips as well, especially if you\'re with a friend who can carry things or push a cart, both of which are harder to do with the sling on.She\'s also a million times more comfortable in the sling than in her car seat, where she often cries.  Our NoJo Babysling has been in constant use since it arrived, and ties the bouncy seat (where she mostly sleeps by day) as the best return on investment of any of the baby gizmos we bought.  Our sitter will often wear the baby for her entire nap. The sitter just sits (often in a rocking chair or porch swing to provide some more movement) and reads while the baby sleeps.One last thing that\'s great is that when the baby falls asleep, she can be laid down on the bed or bouncy chair and the sling just slips off the wearer without waking the baby.I did not watch the video, but did read the sling chapter in the Baby Book, which was helpful. We have recently started using the kangaroo (facing out) position as the baby loves looking at the outside world now. It\'s nice to have this sort of flexibility.  If you are getting tired carrying around your baby, and would like an extra hand free, a sling is a great investment and while not the most elegant, the NoJo is a good workhorse one to use on a daily basis.",5

"782","Recaro Signo Convertible Car Seat Midnight Desert","Really wanted to love this car seat but it is such a pain to get my 11 month daughter in and out of in our Maxima.  We CAN\'T wait to turn the car seat around because I think it will be easier once it is front facing.  It also causes a MAJOR blind spot in this car.  (which may also be resolved once the car seat is front facing)  Other than that, the fabric is very soft and she seems fairly comfortable with the side head rests.  In our primary car we have the Britax Marathon and it is much easier to use.  It also reclines more in the rear facing position so she looks a tad bit more comfy.  I wanted to love the Recaro over the Britax but that currently isn\'t the case.  Again, I may feel differently about it when we can turn it around.",2
"783","Comfort &amp; Harmony Portable Swing, Penelope Petals","After looking at several swings, finally settled on this one, because it was a decent price, looked adorable and was portable (we had a portable for our previous baby, and she had liked it better than the full-size we had). So we\'ve had it for about a week now, and it works wonderfully for our daughter, and is great for the price. The toys are cute, and the flower one has a small baby mirror on it facing baby; there\'s also a removable head cushion/bumper for infants, and I like the five-point harness with Velcro\'ed buckle cover. The tension of the cloth seat is quite supportive; also, yes baby can end up leaning to one side or the other or even forward, but that\'s no different from how they lean in an infant carseat or any other baby swing.There\'s a good selection of swing speeds, and the music has two volumes (although a third one that\'s a little softer than the current lower volume setting would have been nice). Also like that the swing timer can be set for 15, 30 or 45 minutes, and the music has a separate timer of its own, though you don\'t have control of that - you can only hit the button once to turn it on, a second time to set it to the higher volume, and a third time to shut it off. And a bonus for households with gamer nerds (like us): the swing\'s music sounds a lot like what you\'d expect to hear in a Final Fantasy game.",5

We\'re using with a Graco Click Connect 35 system and Graco Relay stroller.  Works fine with the handle, existing canopies, etc - no need to disassemble anything.  Such a simple product but will likely prove invaluable.Also really great for keeping strangers from touching the baby.",5

Powder does not seep over into the other compartments at all, and it flows out so easily and quickly directly into a bottle.  The only reason I didn\'t rate this 5 stars is because sometimes I really have to wrestle with the lid to get it off, but that could just be user-error.

"802","Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","We first got the Sony 900MHz monitor with receivers.  They were really great; we put the monitor in his room and one receiver on each floor. The range was really so-so since it loses signal if the baby is sleeping on the second floor and I\'m in the basement doing laundry.  We had a few scares with the baby (once with a shortness of breathe and another time where we found him sleep with his blanket covering his face) so I decided to get a video monitor instead (my husband wasn\'t so convinced and thought I was being paranoid).  I got the Motorola monitor from Buy Buy Baby with the 20% off coupon which includes an extra monitor.  It definitely gave me a peace of mind.  I put the monitor on the nightstand next to me when I sleep and whenever I hear a noise, I just look at the monitor to make sure he\'s ok and if I needed to get up to fix his blanket or to comfort him.  We keep one camera in the nursery and one in his play area, and it easily lets us switch between the two cameras.  It has a speaker so if I need to talk thru the monitor, I can.  Even though our baby to understand my commands like ""Don\'t eat that!"", I can use it to watch and tell my husband ""Don\'t give him that!"". The music feature was a bit too loud for my baby.  I tried turning it on once and ended up keeping him wide awake instead of putting him to sleep.  However I get full signal in the basement wit this.  My mom takes care of my baby while we\'re at work and she uses the Sony monitor.  She ended up having to walk up and down the stairs to check up on him once in a while.  So the difference between the Sony monitor and the Motorola one, besides having a peace of mind and video vs sound, is that it is 1 Sony monitor (mic) with 2 receivers  vs.  2 Motorola cameras with 1 monitor plus better signal strength.",5

The carrier is light weight, easy to get the baby in and out of and she feels secure and happy while hanging out facing forward (I haven\'t tried the inward facing position).Definitely worth trying for the price!",5
"811","Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","I bought this because we travel a lot and it was the only stroller at the time that was an inline that folded with both seats attached. It is VERY easy to maneuverand easy to get both kids in and out of. My older son likes sitting on the bottom part- he thinks its an adventure. HUGE sunshade, and HUGE basket in the bottom...can carry everything but the kitchen sink. This was (and still is) my fav double inline stroller. Very happy with the purchase and would def recommend to a friend. (Although it is quite heavy with both seats attached...but that is expected as a double stroller)",5

I was going to go with a more expensive one with the bassinet and toy bar but since my daughter is about 8 mos old, I decided on this. Couldn\'t be happier. You can\'t really see the pad on the bottom of the picture but it\'s completely black and seems like it would hold up for a good amount of time.  It\'s also way bigger than I expected it to be. Great color and very functional. Super easy to set up. I didn\'t even really need the directions. All in all a great playard.",5

It has a soft, cushiony seat and a high back that helps support my 4 month old since she can\'t fully sit up on her own. The harness (which she normally hates) is not cumbersome and she doesn\'t seem to mind it at all. The food tray slides on and off very easy from the front ( no way she can get to it), and it cleans up easily, too.  SHe is on the heavier side (17lbs) and there is not a significant gap between her and the food tray so I don\'t think we will have many issues of food being dropped between the tray and her once she starts eating regular foods. For now I am just trying to get her used to the high chair and sitting up and so far she loves it. So glad I bought this chair (and I researched several before settling on this one).",5

"821","My Brest Friend Breastfeeding Pillow, Natural","I was so excited when I received my Breast Feeding Pillow from my Brest Friend to start using it! I also got a set of soft burp cloths as well. The pillow so far has blown away all my expectations and then some. It is so much more comfortable than any other breast-feeding pillow I have used. I love that it elevates the baby so there is no straining or uncomfortable positions for the baby or me. The fact that it hooks around your body is genius and makes the use of pillows behind your back less necessary. The back support is wonderful and the little pocket in front conveniently holds water, a cell phone, or whatever you might need. I love that it feels more like a comfortable mattress than a pillow. The cover also comes off and is washable. I have had the best and most comfortable experience so far and am sure it will only continue. I will definitely be recommending to all of my mom friends and expectant mom friends.",5

"824","Turbo Booster Youth Booster Seat: Blue Checkers Print","We have liked this seat for the two years my daughter has been using it.

(We have an older high-back booster that has an unwashable one--not very practical for kids!) It is also lightweight, so my daughter can take it with her when she goes with grandma or her aunt sometimes. I like the cup-holder idea, though in our van, we don\'t need them. However, it would be really handy were any cup-holders not close enough to reach, or if you didn\'t have any. I really appreciate the fact that the high back can be purchased and added to this seat if you need it! Very smart design! Graco has really engineered a great booster seat system in recent years. Good buy for any child who is ready for this seat and fits properly!",NA

"826","The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","We bought the stroller a year ago. It is light and cheap, and easy to maneuver. The top pocket is very handy, the basket is decent for an umbrella stroller. All in all a good product. But I wouldn\'t buy it again. Before buying this stroller we used quinny buzz. After getting a taste of the umbrella I didn\'t want to mess with bulky quinny anymore, umbrella stroller is just easier to get in and out of the car, get through the aisles when shopping, get to the stands in crowded Farmer\'s Market, etc. So after using it exclusively for a year, taking it near and far (as far as the southernmost city in the world), I must tell, it is not durable at all. We got it in brown, the lighter seat got dirty pretty quickly, it doesn\'t come off, and sponging it with soap water doesn\'t really get dirt out. After one of the gate check ins, we received it with a bent wheel. Thy handles\' grips started wearing out after 4 months or so, now they are both ripped, and about to fall off altogether. I could never figure out how to fold it with the canopy attached, without getting the canopy dirty with dusty wheels or without bending the canopy. I am petite, but my average size husband complains about the short stride space, if he walks in his natural stride, his feet hit the back wheels, I guess higher handles would be a solution to that problem. When trying to unfold it, the lock can be hard to unsnap, a breeze if you have two hands free to get the job done, but I never had a success unlocking it with one hand, say when you are holding a baby. We got it for $35 and my husbands biggest argument was, that if it doesn\'t last, we can buy a second one, and it will still be cheaper than buying a $100+ umbrella stroller. We paid $35, I guess he was right, but I keep gazing at Maclarens, Combis, Icoos and such this days, thinking that having something fun and durable to use might have been worth spending extra extra $. After all an umbrella stroller is the most useful item among the baby gear and can be used up till the kid is 3-4 years old. Looking back I would have definitely gotten snap and go for the first months and switched to expensive umbrella at about 7 months.",2

"828","Beatrix New York Juju the Ladybug Cozy Can","I don\'t like my 21 month old drinking out of plastic straw cups so I\'ve purchased an arsenal of stainless steel cups.  No glass because let\'s be real here .... you don\'t trust a 21 month old with a glass bottle.  Especially when we\'re out and about.  But for every stainless steel thermos style straw cup I would put in front of her, she would reject it and ask for a plastic one instead.  Or one just like mommy.  The cozy can FINALLY solved my problems.  It\'s cute enough that she likes the design and doesn\'t really notice that it\'s stainless steel.  The designs are cute and doesn\'t wash off like I was originally worried about.  She loves this thing.  And, if the top is flipped down, it doesn\'t leak.  It\'s a screw top so you can twist it on tightly.  No leaks people.  Good stuff here.  So those are its selling points.This is my gripe with the cozy can - when you wash the mouth piece, there is NO WAY to clean the top sippy/mouth piece part.  The hole is so tiny that even my flexible straw cleaner that\'s super thin won\'t fit.  Plus the lid and mouth piece are CONNECTED. So I just can\'t clean it.  I\'ve been leaving it submerged in hot water to clean it and trying to get as much as I can with the various sized cleaning wands I have.This helps my little girl drink water with a stainless steel container.  I love that.  I\'m hating the architecture of the design of the lid.  A clean freak mother\'s worst nightmare.  I was going to buy additional ones if she took to it well for milk and for juice but considering the issues I\'m having with the lid, I may not use them for milk or juice.",4

I\'m keeping it only cause I am pregnant with twins and I predict bed rest in my future, so I can use it to prop me up or maybe set on my lap so I can have a bowl or plate of food in front of me.

"832","Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle","Overall, our 6 month old loves the jumper! Plus, it is super easy to put up. Reading the reviews for other similar products, I would still choose this one. The four star rating comes from these things to keep in mind:Leg HolesFor some reason, the leg holes in this jumper are enormous. Really, I\'m not sure who it was designed for. They are even much too big for our 6 year old. I constructed another very simple seat, mirroring her walker\'s 14 inch circumference leg holes, and sewed it into the existing seat- works fine! Without it, it was just okay- mostly, she would sink into one of the leg openings which made her uneasy and lob-sided.Door SizeIf you use this on a smaller door (under the regular three foot door frame), you DO have to watch to make sure their arms don\'t get jammed as they jump. Unfortunately, due to the molding on our doors (see below), the only place we can put it up is a smaller bathroom doorway, so we have to be careful.Wall & MoldingAs another reviewer states, you have to be sure your walls are under 6.5 inches (16.5 cm) thick. Also, look to see how close the molding/door frame goes up to the ceiling. It needs to have about 1.5 inches (4 cm) between the molding and the ceiling for it to properly attach.Initial ReactionOur daughter\'s initial reaction to it- scared! I\'m not sure what it was; she has the walker and has used a floor bouncer, both of which she liked. We had her sit in the jumper, resting on the bed. She was fine with that and after an hour or so, we put it up. She started bouncing and hasn\'t looked back.We\'re still glad we bought the jumper, and our baby girl enjoys it!",4
"833","Fisher-Price Easy-on Infant Carrier - Black","I\'ve been playing with this carrier for about a month now, and I have to say - I\'m impressed.  I have to confess that my mother is acquainted with the guy who designed this product for Fisher Price, so I had heard about this item and was eager to try it.  I have a four month old baby boy.  We were given a Baby Bjorn as a shower gift, and I used that for comparison.  I also use a New Native baby sling.First off - it\'s much easier to put the baby in than the Baby Bjorn.  The entire piece that the baby sits in snaps off and is easy to put the baby in - you lay him on it like a diaper and zip up the sides.  It\'s designed so the parent puts their harness on first.  You then pick up the baby and snap his harness on to yours.  Soooo easy, and much less hassle for the baby.  The connection is very secure - it\'s a five-point system.  It takes a bit of practice to master getting the baby out - I prefer to sit down to unhook the harness.  It is also just as easy to unzip it and pop the baby out over the top.The baby can be worn forward or backward.  Requires no major adjustment to accomplish this.  Good for up to 25 lbs, and a cinch to adjust for length.The adult harness seems to distribute the baby\'s weight more evenly across my hips than other carriers and slings.  I have more stamina with this carrier than my sling, which my baby loves but I find quite cumbersome.One feature I love - it has a toy ring attached so you link a toy on it - fantastic so your baby\'s favorite item doesn\'t end up in the dirt.The fabric is ultra-soft and cushiony, like thick foam covered with microfiber.  This is especially true around the baby\'s legs. In fact this item is ideal for people whose babies have chubby thighs - the leg openings are nice and big, with no pinching - yet the baby is still secure.  I find that our Baby Bjorn is a bit tight around his legs.  Despite the padding, this product has great airflow for the baby and adult, too - we live in Florida.  Drool and spit-up seem to just wipe right off the fabric.  The shoulder straps are nicely padded.  One thing I would mention - the fabric on the inside of the shoulder pads is like a cooling mesh, and can be a bit tough when worn on bare skin (when wearing a tank top etc).  I solved this problem by wrapping a bit of soft fabric around the straps where they sat against my neck.  It would be nice it this came with something to solve this problem, like adult sized versions of the strap covers on a car seat.  But wearing it with a T-shirt should not be a problem.I have to say - I have comandeered this product for my exclusive use - my hubby wears the Baby Bjorn now!",NA
"834","Combi Torino DX Stroller Lawn","We have owned this stroller for 6 months.  It has served us pretty well so far.  It\'s light weight, has a large canopy, my son is comfortable in it.  I put him in it fully reclined from 2 months on.  We have the car seat the goes with this as well, and it was too hot to have him in the car seat in the stroller during the summer months, there wasn\'t enough air circulation in there for him. He\'d overheat and get really cranky.  But with the stroller in recline position, I could go for walks and he could sleep and not get too hot.  I do love and use the three seat positions all the time, and seems to be good for our son as well.  He\'s at the age he wants to see everything, so we\'ll sit him up all the way, but if he gets a little sleepy, we just recline all the way down and he goes to sleep.  My only complaints about this stroller are that with the seat all the way reclined, you cannot access the basket under the stoller at all.  And the other thing was the handle.  My husband and I are a little tallish (6\' and 5\'7"") and the handle feels short to both of us.  We both kick the wheels.  Oh, and it\'s worth mentioning that Air Canada would not let me gate check this stroller.  I had to check it with the rest of my luggage.  Hope this is helpful.",4

I also loved the fact that they were designed by a nurse and ""Proudly made in USA using USA cotton."" Unfortunately, this is not true! The tag inside clearly says ""Made in China.""Out of the package, the chemical odor was overwhelmingly noxious. Comparing side by side with the A & A, the material is thin, rough, scratchy, and cheap-feeling. The pattern is not cut/sewn straight, the stitching is erratic and poorly done with areas that bunch up and overlap. There are loose threads and loops all throughout the edging. The material is one thin layer vs A&A; is a slightly thicker double layer. The A&A; is significantly softer, smoother, with a thicker ""gauzy"" feel - right out of the package - with absolutely NO odor. (I posted some pics above).I can\'t comment to how washing this blanket would\'ve improved things as I am absolutely returning it to Amazon. If you\'re not overly picky about patterns, you could pick up A & A blankets for the same exact price, as the prices on Amazon are quite variable.

"852","bumGenius One-Size Cloth Diaper Twilight","These are specific instructions for how we use this product.  This is what works for us and the information I think is relevant.  We\'ve been using 15 of these almost exclusively for 3 months with no issues (we do wash every day).1. You must use an approved detergent or the material will get a waxy coating and not absorb (leak).  It must also have no additives.  The detergent that works for you may depend on your water.  We use Planet, a powder detergent available from Whole Foods.  Our backup detergent is Country Save powder available at New Seasons Market or here on Amazon.2. IMPORTANT - We use dried baby wipes (Costco brand) as liners in the diapers.  This was a huge discovery in terms of cleanup.  We can discard most of the waste on the soiled liner with minimal diaper rinsing needed.  You can actually wash and dry wipes that have only been peed on with the diapers.  When cleaning the baby of pee, I toss the used liner in the dirty diaper bin to be used as a liner later.  When you do need to rinse, remove the insert first and leave the diaper in the pale wet. We have a handheld bidet (mini shower) installed on the toilet which makes rinsing much easier.  These are easy to install and are useful beyond diaper cleaning.3. We wash the diapers once in warm water with  of the recommended detergent.  Sometimes there is a faint stain but the stains don\'t usually survive the second wash.  This is less washing than Bumgenius recommends but we want to minimize washing effort.4. If  the diapers start leaking after a few months, you may have a detergent build up.  You can strip the diapers using one tablespoon of  blue Dawn for a regular washer or  for HE in hot water.  Rinse two more times in hot water (water only).  You can also add up to  cup of bleach if you have a smell issue (we haven\'t yet).5. We dry diapers on medium heat.  We try not to over-dry to prolong the life of  the diaper.6. Be diligent about using the Velcro tabs when washing to keep your Velcro sticky.7. Do not use diaper rash cream with these diapers.  It will get through the liner onto the diaper.8. Save your money on overpriced plastic diaper pail gizmos.  Get a quality small metal step-lid can that will fit a plactic grocery bag.  You will need one for washing and one for discards.",5

I have a moby wrap & a baby bjorn.. they bjorn is a bit quicker to get on, but kills my back after only a few min.\'s. the moby was great when my baby was little & easier to nurse in, but everytime i had to take her out it was so streched that i would have to redo the whole thing which is a pain & it was very hot! i live in Alaska & it was wintertime when she was born.. so i can\'t imagine living somewhere warm & using it. with the ergo i can wear it for hours before my back hurts if at all. but i have back issues so its probably not the carriers fault. got the Heart 2 heart insert, cuz she wwas only 3 moths old when i got it & it was great! if she fell asleep while in it i could take her out in the insert lay her down & she would sleep like that nicely. They only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i\'m over 6\' & pretty thin.. the shoulder straps get in my way sometimes. they are so padded that even though they are confrotable they get in the way on my shoulders. but i deal with it fine. still would buy it again in a heart beat! & the galaxy grey is so cute!",NA

"861","Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Our daughter is 13 months old and we\'ve been using the Diaper Champ ever since she was born. I highly recommend it because it\'s a great value.  However, there are a few things to be aware of which is why I only gave 4 stars.1. Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC. My husband learned the hard way that the grips get stuck on the seal and the diaper won\'t drop into the bag.  Then you have to pull the diaper out and the grips slowly pull away the seal.  It didn\'t seem to affect the odor control, but it did make it difficult to move the handle/shoot back and forth.  The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2. The unit is top heavy when it\'s empty. I learned this one the hard way.  When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.  Ouch!!3. No, the stink isn\'t completely trapped, but it\'s pretty darn close! The stinkiest part is emptying a full bag.  I found that putting a stick-up inside the lid has made it much more tolerable.",4

"863","Imagine Baby Products Newborn Stay Dry All-In-One Snap Cloth Diaper, Emerald","I was very excited to be getting this diaper, as it is a all in one and I thought that might be good for a newborn. The reason in only giving 3 stars is because I did not receive a all in one, I simply just received a diaper cover for a prefold, I decided to just keep it since I am using prefolds also but it would be nice to actually get what is being sold here.",3
"864","Tiny Love Tiny Princess Mobile","We love this mobile!  I have to agree that it doesn\'t fit on some cribs, but it does fit on the side rails of ours.  It\'s not adjustable to different sizes so you will have to make sure it fits for you before ordering.  Otherwise we LOVE it!!  Our daughter will sit and look at this forever.  Even when she is crabby and teething, it instantly soothes her.  We\'ve had this since birth and she\'s now almost 5 months old.  Once she starts crawling we can take the mobile arm off and leave the music box for her to play with.  Oh, and the most surprising thing: we\'ve never changed the batteries!!  We started using it at around 2 months, and we play it every single night, with no replacing batteries.  This is SO much better than any cheesy mobile that comes with bedding sets.",5
"865","Safety 1st High-Def Digital Monitor","After a week of fuzz from theGraco Digital Deluxe iMonitor Baby Monitor. We returned it and bought this product on impulse at Target. This monitor is very simple to use and crystal clear. (As I am writing this review I can hear the clock ticking in the nursery.)Pros:+One button operation. (Turn on the baby-unit, turn on the parent-unit...done. There is no channel button to worry about.)+Crystal clear. No static even at max volume.+Loudest setting is loud enough.+Lights show level of noise baby is making.+Neat design. (This may sound weird, but baby monitors are for parents...not for babies. So why do so many of them look like toys?)+Uses 3 AAA NiMH rechargeable batteries. (So they can be easily replaced if needed. Or if you don\'t plug it in, you can just use regular AAA\'s.)+Only one parent unit (If you think you need two parent units, you should try either getting a smaller house or trusting your spouse.)+Range sufficiently covers our house and yard.Cons:-I have my doubts about the belt clip. No problems yet, though.-There is no charging cradle for the parent unit. So you have to plug in the cord every time. (Not a huge deal, but it would be nice.)We haven\'t had it long enough to speak to its durability and battery life, but for now we are very happy with this product.Bottom-line: We feel like we can trust this baby monitor.UPDATE: Almost a year later, this monitor is still working great! We have no issues with interference or degrading quality. The batteries still hold their charge. Only complaint is the belt clip because it comes off easily. But this thing has fallen many times onto the hard tile floor and it still works fine.",5

The joovy groove ultralight weight allowed to have my toddler who is very tall for her age fully recline and sleeping with no problems. The canopy is big enough to cover her from the sun and other elements. The basket is big enough to place a medium size diaper bag and the cup holder is good for a 7 oz bottle",5

This does pretty well at keeping it contained; sometimes there are still goldfish crackers in my 2yr old daughter\'s carseat - but that\'s more because of her and not the container! This does the best job that I could find - an open container just does not work! The only thing ""negative"" is that is does seem to ""scrape"" her fingers. And I hesitate to even say ""scrape"" because it\'s not a true scrape, but after using this her fingers are red and raw. Other than that it\'s a pretty useful product.",4

I laugh that people use these things as bibs for eating - but if you have a particularly messy (and creative) eater, they serve a dual purpose then.  I had to search to find something that covered all the basics so that my daughter can paint in peace and not destroy her outfit.

"893","ThumbGuard LG (7-15 yrs.)","I got this for my daughter when she was almost 5 and it worked successfully. She wanted to stop sucking her thumb before she started Kindergarten to be a ""big girl"". She didn\'t fight with me about wearing it. In fact, she would remind me to put it on her after baths or when she got home from preschool. After about a month, she no longer sucked her thumb. BUT, that is when she started biting her nails. Since the product worked for her, I decided when my son turned 4 that it was time to get one for him. He hated it! He cried when I put it on and successfully pulled his thumb out of it every time. It didn\'t matter how tight I put it on, if he wanted it off, he would just pull on it to slip his thumb out. The only way to have kept it on, would of been to put it so tight that it would nearly cut his circulation off. (Which of course, would of been way to tight)  My point is...The child has to be willing to stop sucking thier thumb or be under constant watch so they won\'t slip their thumb out, in order for this product to work. My now 5 year old son still sucks his thumb :(  Also, I would reccommend getting extra wrist bracelets.",3
"894","The First Years True Fit Convertible Car Seat, Monet","Whoever thinks this seat is easy to install, I hope you realize car seats are only supposed to move left to right an inch or less, preferably less.  I\'m guessing a huge number of you just flat out have this seat installed wrong.  First off the convoluted anchor lock system in the base of the seat is stupid.  Second it took every once of force in my almost 200lb husbands body to get this seat snugged down to the point where it wouldn\'t move all over the place.  He literally had to slide a wrench through the loop in the strap to get enough force to tighten it to the proper level.Anyway the seat itself seems great but installation was horrible.",2

"897","Baby Trend Expedition LX Jogging Stroller, Vanilla Bean","I actually have the ELX of this brand, but they are very similar. Mine included the built-in mp3 speakers. I have read a lot of the reviews that complain about the wobbly front wheel, and with a quick Google search... it is an easy fix. If you turn the stroller upside down and undo a few screws where the footrest is, there is a bolt that holds the wheel on to the main frame of the stroller. If you just tighten up that bolt a little bit, the front wheel is still allowed to swivel but it\'s not quite as loose. That prevents the wheel from being wobbly when jogging or walking fast. I actually like that you can control the maneuverability of that wheel with just a slight tighten or loosen of that bolt. But this definitely fixes the wobbly wheel issue. Once we fixed that one small issue, we never again had any problems. The stroller is excellently built, the basket underneath is very easily accessible and roomy & the overall build of the stroller is solid. I love that the handle can be repositioned to two different comfort levels, as well as collapsing completely to allow for the stroller to fit better inside of a trunk or a vehicle. I also love that the shoulder straps and safety buckle are easy to use. The stroller maneuvers wonderfully and glides like a dream. I quickly listed my other stroller for sale as soon as I got one of these. It\'s great for every day use as well as more off road type use at parks & such. It\'s nicely sized, but not too big either. Overall we are very satisfied with it!",5
"898","Graco My Ride 65 DLX Convertible Car Seat, Empire","After a great deal of research, we purchased this seat because we felt it was a good combination of safety and value. My husband and I both drive Ford Explorers (mine is a 2002 two-door sport, his is a full size 2010) so we didn\'t think the size would be an issue. It barely fit rear-facing in the center position of the 2010 explorer, and we felt like it took a great deal of effort to get a secure fit with the LATCH compared to our Chicco Key fit 30 infant seat. We are both relatively tall, and it would not have fit in either of the outboard positions AND accommodated our need for a little extra leg room in that vehicle. We tried to install it in the 2002 with a seat belt (not equipped with LATCH) and completely abandoned the effort after a half hour of sweating and swearing. It also barely fit in the back seat of that vehicle, and we couldn\'t get a secure fit with the older model seat belt. Again, we had no trouble achieving a secure fit with our Chicco Key Fit 30 with a seat belt installation in this vehicle. Once the seat was securely installed in the 2010 Explorer, we were not happy with the amount of flex in the top of the car seat. We wished it had a little more reinforcing at the top.The infant head rest did not want to stay in place because it did not actually attach to the seat, and we thought it was much more difficult to unbuckle the harness than it was in our Chicco seat.On the bright side, the fabric was breathable, and our hot-natured son stayed cool and comfortable during our trip.We would have returned it, but our son expressed his opinion of the seat by exploding a diaper on our trial outing. Yes, darling, Daddy and I think this seat is crap, too. Since we are fairly certain Amazon has a no-skidmark return policy, we laundered the cover and are planning to use it in my mother\'s LATCH-equipped sedan, in the center position, for the rare occasions she needs a car seat.",2

It folds up into quarters, so I have no problems carrying one in my bag around either. (admittedly, though, I do carry a huge bag) I keep it with a pack of Clorox wipes and just give it a good wipe down in between uses. The bag I store it in is machine washable so I toss that in the laundry once a week. I\'d highly recommend this to anyone.",5

I checked out breast pump bras here on Amazon.com and found this style and saw all the great reviews (I got the Simple Wishes in black). They haven\'t lied! I ended up having an emergency c-section at 8 months +NICU and getting breastfeeding going was a real challenge. After 3 months of nursing, supplementing and pumping, we finally got things working well. I couldn\'t have handled the extensive pumping time without this bra and the use of my hands.

"906","Philips AVENT Isis iQ Duo Twin Electronic Breast Pump","I did a lot of research and going back and forth before purchasing this product. I was trying to decide between a Medela Pump-in-Style and the Avent Isis iQ Duo. Almost all the reviews for the Medela were very positive and my cousin and sister-in-law had used it and liked it. I found a lot of positive reviews for the Avent as well so I had a hard time deciding. I spoke with a pump specialist (he and his wife own a lactation store specializing in bras and pumps and other things for breastfeeding) and he recommended the Avent because he said there was no problem with ever getting milk in the tubing, the bottles are designed much better for breastfeeding infants, the stimulators in the cups, and because of the iQ feature - it ""memorizes"" your preferred pumping pattern. He said the actual pumps, machine-wise, were comparable. I read a review in which a women who had tried both pumps said that parts were harder to get for the Avent. So I considered getting the medela for convenience. I tried the avent manual pump and I liked it, so I actually decided to go with the pump that I could get the best deal on since I couldn\'t really decide, and it turned out to be the Avent. I have loved it. It works very fast. Now I have not tried any other electric pump, but it is sure faster than the manual. I find it very easy to use and put together. I do not hurt from using it. I may be a little more tender than just breastfeeding, but it really isn\'t bad. I love the bag that it comes with -its very easy to store the pump and parts and cart around. One review that I read said that the tubing was very stiff and she spilled milk trying to deal with the tubing. I have no idea what she is talking about because i have absolutely no problems with the tubing or taking it off. I do not pump every day. I pump when I get the chance, and I have not had the pump for very long so I can\'t say anything as to how long the pump lasts, but I have been very pleased with this pump and am glad that I bought it. I also like the Avent bottles. My baby is a gulper and she does really well with not swallowing so much air with them.",NA

Sometimes, it was a great way to get him to fall asleep or a quick place to secure him when I needed two hands free.  It was used moderately--not $100+ worth.I enjoyed the classical music, but the other sounds were more like white noise than their description.  The adults could not tolerate them.The mobile has nothing for a child.  From the child\'s view is just the underside of turtles (a circle with nubs) in hard to distinguish pastel colors.  In fact, my son stared at the bright warning label on the inside of the stand longer in one sitting than he ever looked at the mobile over the lifetime of the swing.I HATED the tray.  It was a useless obstacle in reaching my non-mobile infant (the harness seemed more than sufficient for safety).  By the time my child was old enough to use the tray, he didn\'t use the swing.Overall, the swing worked as it should and we didn\'t have issues with its operation.  The timer was a nice feature that we rarely used.  It always remained in its lowest position, despite having other more upright settings.",3

"923","Kid\'Sleep Classic, Blue","This ""clock"" works like a charm for our daughter.  We bought it for her when she was 2 1/2 years old.  She understood the concept right away.  She is now 4 1/2 and still uses it.  When she wakes up before her ""bunny is running"", she just lays in her bed until her bunny wakes up.  Most of the time now she sleeps until after her bunny wakes up anyway.  I love that the transition from night to day is silent, so it doesn\'t wake her.  We used to use a nightlight on a timer to tell her when it was day, but that made a clicking noise when it went off that would wake her up if she happened to still be sleeping then.  This clock has been great for us.  Her little sister, who is 22 months old, is asking for her own clock now.  We will be buying a second one.  The programming is not difficult, as the other reviewers claim.  Yes, you have to reset it when the power goes out or you unplug it, but that takes all of 1 minute.  GREAT PRODUCT!",5

The quality and pattern (cowmooflouge) are two features that I love, but most of all the safety features. We upgraded to this from a Graco infant carrier and love it! Our daughter is 8 months old and very small, but was tired of laying back so far in the infant carrier. She seems so comfortable in this car seat! We are so excited for her to grow with this car seat and also have the ability to be comfortable and safe! I did have a little trouble the first day with getting the straps loose, but it\'s a breeze now that I have figured it out. Other reviews added that the seat is bulky and hard to get the baby in and out of... I don\'t think it\'s anymore difficult than putting her into the infant carrier.",NA

We just got back from our first trip to Walt Disney World with our kids, and put one on both our almost 3 year old and our almost 1 year old.  Both kids were a little fidgety when I put the stickers on and when I wrote in my phone #, but otherwise they didn\'t have a problem with them.  Never  fussed about them feeling uncomfortable at all.  We put them on the first day of a week long vacation and the stickers stayed on even after we arrived home, even through multiple baths.  The ink from the pen provided stayed sharp as well.I had room on my son\'s sticker to write our phone # and the words ""PEANUT ALLERGY"" below it.  I know that this was noticeable to people because we got a lot of comments not only on the kids\' tattoos but they even mentioned ""oh he has a peanut allergy?""  Great for kids with food allergies!  Safetytat does make tattoos with allergy information printed on them, but I wanted the ""quick stick"" version because they are stick on, no water required!  The designs are cute.  Because they stayed on for the entire trip, I only had to use 1 tattoo for each kid, leaving 4 more for other trips, making this a better value than you might think initially.EXCELLENT PRODUCT!  I will tell all of my friends, especially those travelling with toddlers, about these.  LOVE THEM!",5

I had to go ahead and buy a cushioned one so she might actually stay on the toilet for more than a few seconds.

On the flip side, it seems easy to keep clean (though she hasn\'t actually gone to the bathroom on it yet!).",2
"933","Philips AVENT Digital Video Baby Monitor","I got this monitor as a gift. I was very hesitant to buy a monitor with a camera because I wanted to give the baby some privacy (crazy I know lol) and I didn\'t want to become paranoid by watching the baby all the time, so I bought a regular monitor and returned it after trying it out (the signal was AWFUL). Later I got this monitor as a gift from a very dear friend so I didn\'t have the heart to return it and decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did. The sound and image quality is excellent! I love the round base because it makes it easy to direct the camera in the angle you want. It also plays 3 different rhymes, which my baby could not sleep without during the first few weeks after she was born. It drove me INSANE but it was worth the sleep I got in return lol I have only used the camera while on the base but I think it can be hung as well (not sure). The one thing I did not particularly like is that the camera has to be plugged in power supply to work. It does not run on battery so this limits how much you can move it around, but that doesn\'t bother me so much as most of the time the monitor is in the nursery. Also, for those who have wifi at home, the monitor runs on the same frequency as some internet connections so when you have it switched on while trying to surf the internet, it will CONSIDERABLY slow down your connection. That\'s the case in our home but only when the monitor is right next to the computer. Otherwise it does not affect it at all. Despite that, I absolutely LOVE this monitor and would not trade it for another one.Funny side note: When the room is dark, the infra red light is activated, so it feels as if my baby is starring in a baby version of paranormal activity :) lol",4

"936","The First Years 3-in-1 Kickin Coaster Seat, Green/Yellow","I bought this for my daughter when she was 3 months old despite the reviews that said it was not worth the money.  At the time she was hitting all of her gross motor milestones early (the pediatrician was surprised to see her hitting many of the 6 month ones at her 4 month check up).  Like others, I found that it was difficult for her to reach the kick surface (at the time she was 24"").  I did not give up, figuring she would grow into it.  She is now 6 months and has just started to sit in it for longer than 5 minutes without being frustrated and bored.  She does ""jump"" now, but she is so long that now her head hits the top of the seat.  In addition, she gets bored after 15 minutes maximum.  The kick board is not sensitive enough to respond with the light/song when she kicks.  However, she will watch the light show when it is set on continuous play.  I would recommend purchasing a jumper similar to the ""Jumparoo"" if you have an active baby over 5 months of age.",2

"940","Travel System - Malawi","My Husband and I were in the Babies ""R"" Us store comparing travel systems and pretty much had one in mind, already.  I saw the colors on the Malawi Travel System and it caught my attention.  As we were looking at it\'s features, an associate that works at the store walked by us and said only these words to us, ""You don\'t want that one.""  He kept on walking to assist a customer with something and we went over to ask him what it was about this travel system that made him say not to purchase it.  All he had to do was to walk back over to where we were looking at the model and he proceeded to reach over and quickly grab the release on the top of the handle, which could easily be grabbed by anyone by mistake (or by an accompanying child walking with you).  In a flash, the entire stroller, car seat and all, collapsed, flipping the carseat backwards and hitting the floor.  If a baby were to be in the stroller and that happened, the baby would flip back and crack his/her head on the ground, resulting in serious injury or death!  This quick reaction made my Husband and I drop our jaws to the floor and we were speechless!  We picked-up the flattened stroller and placed the car seat back on the top of the stroller and rolled it back to where it was on display.  We decided to purchase what we initially went in for and that was the ever-popular, true-blue, ""Graco"" brand in the MetroLite series of travel systems - ""Delancy"" pattern.  I feel very sorry for people that have already purchased the ""Malawi"" travel system, that have no idea the danger that may lie ahead for their precious cargo.  Needless to say, I hope that I can be of help in your decision making process, by what I saw first hand in the store.  BUYER BEWARE!",1

"942","Best Bottom Cloth Diapers - Snap - Orange Sherbet","We\'ve been using Best Bottoms for about 3 months now.  Overall, we like them a lot.  We had a small baby (&lt; 6 lbs) and couldn\'t use them right away, but by the time he was ~8 lbs they worked fine.  One of the straps has a snap on the outside so you can overlap them for newborns and small infants.  Very smart design.  The liners are super easy to snap in and remove.  The reason we went with these is so that we could just wash the inserts rather than the whole diaper in the case of all-in-ones (less to carry around as well).  That works well for wet diapers only, but we find that we have to wash the shell when there\'s a poopy one.  The poop tends to run over the edge of the insert and sometimes even gets into the leg gussets a little.  Even so, we\'ve had very few leaks: only 2 in 3 months and both were wet only.  I feel it could have been from us not putting the diaper on quite right though.  The shells come clean and dry quickly (we don\'t put them in the dryer), and they\'ve held up well so far (we wash diapers every other day).  Because there\'s no wetness indicator on cloth diapers, we usually just change diapers on a time schedule or until we hear a poop.  The first stage inserts without any doublers are absorbent enough for about 3 hours for our 5 month old.  The shell is super easy to snap up.  You can take these off and put another one on very quickly.  My only gripe is that I wish the waistband on the shell was stretchy in the front. We have a few bumgenius all-in-ones and those are really stretchy up front - it\'s a nice design.  Sometimes I feel like the diaper is too tight on one snap but too loose on the next looser one.  Nonetheless, like I said, we haven\'t had any major leaking problems.Finally, I just wanted to add a note to those who are hesitant about cloth diapering: don\'t be.  It\'s been great.  Sure, you have to make a pretty good investment up front, but you\'ll have them paid for after a few months if you factor what you\'d be paying for disposable diapers.  We did it mostly for the cost savings, but also because cloth diapering is good for the baby (fewer diaper rashes), and it cuts down A TON on waste.  When we had to use disposables early on I was astonished by how much waste a small baby could generate!  And you don\'t have to handle dirty diapers much at all.  If we have a poopy diaper, we just toss the whole diaper (shell and insert) into a wet bag right away.  When laundry times comes, we dump all the diapers and the wet bag in the washer and start it up.  After the cold rinse cycle, I separate the shells and liners and start the wash cycle.  After a few months of cloth diapering, I find the smell of a dirty disposable diaper to be much worse than anything we\'ve had with the cloth diapers (there\'s no fake baby powder smell for one).We\'ve been happy with the Best Bottoms so far and were happy to support a company that makes their products in the USA.  Best Bottoms are a good option for those looking to cloth diaper.",NA
"943","Flip Potty Trainer Kit 1 trainer + 3 organic cotton pads Sassy / Butternut","I bought a bunch of Alva training pants but they gave my daughter rashes on her legs, leaked and were super difficult to get on and off when she pooped without making a huge mess down her legs (gross!). She\'s 2 and is having a hard time being potty trained so I decided to try one of these. She\'s still having a lot of accidents so I needed something with snaps to easily remove it when she poops. The side tabs are stretchy making it easy to pull up and down. The inside has velcro to hold the inserts in place which makes it easier to pull on and off. It also has laundry tabs to keep it from sticking to everything in the wash. I\'ve had no problems with the snaps coming undone when I pull these up and down. She\'s worn these day and night and we haven\'t had a single leak. I LOVE the organic cotton inserts and wish they made these for the regular Flip covers! Soooooooo much better than microfiber! I like it so much I bought 2 more sets and will buy 1-2 more. 3 sets (3 covers, 9 inserts) but I like having plenty of diapers on hand. I\'ve already recommended these to my friends and family whether they cloth diaper or not.",5

When my husband and I would go out to dinner, we would HATE to put her in one of those dirty, germy restaurant high chairs. You know they DON\'T clean them. We would spend the whole time saying, &amp;amp;quot;oh, don\'t touch that; oh, don\'t chew on that, etc.&amp;amp;quot; It was awful. Now, we just keep it in the car and take it with us every where. We get so many compliments on what a neat product it is and I highly recommend it to everyone who comments on it. It\'s easy to use, it\'s sturdy and the babies love it! It\'s very comfortable for them too. It\'s so comfortable that my daughter has been known, several times, to fall asleep in it while dining!!! GET THIS, YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT!

"947","DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","I purchased this crib in 2008 and it is currently on my second child. We love it. It was a little hard to find a mattress that actually fit this crib. There does not seem to be a standard size for cribs and mattresses.  Because of that, I\'d suggest going with the DaVinci mattress just because you\'re more likely to get a good fit. (I think I even read someone\'s review where the DaVinci mattress didn\'t fit and DaVinci sent her a whole new crib because they figured out it was a manufacturing problem with the crib.)  Full disclosure though, this is not the mattress we wound up getting as I didn\'t know DaVinci made one when we purchased the crib, I wish I had.The crib was easy to put together and has held up well.  We love the way it looks.  The only thing I will say is that my son thought he was part beaver and gnawed off some of the paint.  I don\'t think the paint came off abnormally easy, but the teeth marks are something that might not be as noticeable with a crib that is stained instead of painted.The plus is that its white so it should be fairly easy to touch up when the time comes to convert it to an adult bed.",4

In worse case I can add stroller strap pads sold on amazon for longer walks maybe..?- leg opening could be made with robber band like a hood sides, but maybe legs would hang down more? I keep my baby\'s legs up and she doesn\'t have red marks and it doesn\'t bother her.Other than that I love it. With my son I used Ktan and we both loved it, my baby girl doesn\'t like it, and loved baby bjorn and boba. I also really like the hood, it helps in the summer to protect her still bold head from the sun, and since we live in a Seattle area it will be great during wet winter.I\'m 5\'6\'\' about 132 lb and carrier is great for me. My hubby wore it 5\'11\'\' 165 lb with hoodie on and it wasn\'t as comfy for him like for me, he max out the adjustment and he was relieved when he put it down;)My toddler son is a bit jealous about his baby sister and he wants to be carry in a carrier too.

"959","Britax Boulevard 70 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","Can\'t beat the Cowmooflage!I think a lot was said in the lengthy reviews, but I\'d add:- White on the cover is not really white - it has that slight ""streaky"" pattern in... teething biscuit color. Did not like it in the beginning, but now I know better - you don\'t need to wash the cover every time little hands smear something on it.- The straps are annoying, my poor little dude had his arms scratched a bit a few times, when I was trying to roll the buckles into place.- Yes, it is pricey, and you can buy decent seats for half the price, but this one should be fine up to 70 pounds. Unless you have a huge baby, it should last for about 5 years - even with the original price of $300, it\'s around $60/year. Try buying an infant seat for that much...- Safety features are awesome. Watch a few crash test movies on Youtube. Car seat seems really sturdy, metal frame is a nice feature, buckles wrap around the little person tight, etc.- Comfort - rear facing demands the flattest setting, and the additional strap, that you can add to keep the car seat positioned pulls it even more, so sometimes my son ends up in a semi-flat position. He\'s not happy with that if someone rides in the back seat with him, as he wants to pull up and play. Of course, he doesn\'t have side view either, but for me side view is so much less important than side impact protection... Can\'t have both. Protection > View, sorry, baby.- The CS vs non-CS version - from a few friends with the newer one - you can\'t really hear the click, and it works 1 out of 3 times.

It took me about an hour to put it together, and that\'s including the time it took for me to unscrew one whole side because I forgot to slide the bottom layer in.  Sure, the materials are on the cheaper side, but the structure seems pretty solid.  I recommend laying all of the materials out and going through the steps before actually putting it together.  The allen wrench is an odd shape, but since we\'ve been putting together swings and cribs and other pieces of furniture, I was able to use some of the smaller wrenches included with other furniture for the smaller crevices.

It is doing very little to actually keep odor down.  Flies and gnats can easily get into the pail and if they can get in, you know the odor is getting out.  It is reeking up the bathroom that it is in and our bedroom.  The older model also had an odor problem but not to this degree.

"967","Medela Supplemental Nursing System","I purchased this product in a last ditch effort to assist me in teaching my baby to nurse (I have been exclusively pumping).  I fully expected it to be a challenge, but I was a bit disappointed when I received this.  For the amount of money I had to pay (which was shockingly high), I was surprised at the seemingly thoughtless way it was designed.The opening to the bottle is so small that it is difficult to pour the milk into, and impossible to clean!  I have a regular sized baby bottle brush and it absolutely will not fit into it to clean it.  I wash it in warm soapy water, but there is still a film that gets onto the sides and needs to be scrubbed.  Unless you have a very long, narrow brush, this thing will not be coming clean.Secondly, the instructions say over and over to make sure the tubing stays on top of the nipple, and not to the side of baby\'s mouth.  But, no amount of tape would prevent that from happening, so I got very frustrated with it, and so did my baby.My advice would be that if you are going to spend the money to buy this thing (which I think is way over-priced), you should most definitely find a lactation consultant who is familiar with how to use this product and is willing to work with you until you get used to it.  I could not find anyone near me who had ever seen one, so I was on my own with it, and I think that hindered my success a great deal.I love the idea of this product and think it had potential for great success, but in my opinion, it really needs: 1) To be better designed to come clean, and 2) to be paired with a professional lactation consultant who can help you reach your goal of breastfeeding.",3
"968","Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Musical Activity Mirror","We introduced this toy to our baby at 3 months to help with tummy time. He loved the flashing lights and the music and it kept him interested more than any other tummy toy we had! As he got older, he\'s a little over 5 months now, he started figuring out how to make the music and lights go and he spends all kinds of time playing with it. If it\'s on a blanket near him, he rolls to get it. He likes to chew on the dangly things and loves to look at himself in the mirror. My only complaint is that, when he didn\'t know how to make the lights and music go on his own, I had to hit it repeatedly to keep it going. There is no ""on"" mode that will get it to go on its own. Small problem for an otherwise perfect tummy toy.",NA

When I repot plants, the pots are dirty.  Since I\'m dealing with relatively small pots, they can be hard to clean.  This is the best brush I\'ve found.  I use one when the pots are dry to brush out the extra dirt particles, then use another one in the water to get them clean.My husband also keeps one under the sink to use for glassware and things with a narrow opening.  He is pleased with it for that.One thing I really appreciate about these is that they last much longer than many other bottle brushes I\'ve tried.  Some seem to flatten and become useless in just a month or so.  The last brush I used for my pots lasted almost a year.  In that time, I probably washed at least 700 pots, maybe more, scrubbing them vigorously.",5
"972","Boon Squirt Baby Food Dispensing Spoon in Orange","Can\'t believe I waited for my second baby to try this product! It\'s fantastic!

The only reason I gave this product 4 stars and not 5 is because it does waste some baby food. Like glue, air gets trapped and you  have to give it a shake, but then it pops back and can get messy, but otherwise a great product. A must for on the go parents and its a great traveling item.Boon Squirt Baby Food Dispensing Spoon in Orange",4
"973","Dreambaby Banister Gate Adaptors, Silver","My husband and I bought the Dreambaby pressure mount gate and discovered we needed the adaptor to fit the gate against our round banister.  The banister is wood and has a flat decorative trim around the bottom so we only needed the adaptor for the top portion that fits against the round post.  The adaptor slides easily into the gate and allowed us to install the gate but fair warning it doesn\'t protect the wood very well.  The adaptor comes with a thin layer of padding but because the wood is round and the banister adaptor is V shaped it doesn\'t sit all the way against it and I\'m afraid it has already left small indentions in our banister.  Now that our daughter is more mobile we plan to add another gate to the top of the stairs and have the same banister problem.  This will be the third Dreambaby gate in our home and I still plan to use the banister adaptor but I will add a little extra padding this time.",3

I like that its phthalate-free and BPA-free.Avent categorizes its teethers into three groups:  Stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3.  This is a stage 1 teether, which Avent describes as ""Front teeth:  Massages gums and suitable for sterilization.""  Stage 2 is for middle teeth, and stage 3 is for back teeth.  Basically, stage 1 is for the earliest stage and is appropriate for small babies.  All in all, a good product from a reputable company.",5

We looked at the Graco Nautilus and a few others before settling on this model. We have been very happy so far with ease of installation (we had the new one secure in minutes), and comfort. I was worried the big ""airbags"" would annoy my son, or make it hard for him to see out the window, but that isn\'t the case at all. He is very comfortable and even fell asleep within minutes of riding around town in his new seat. His head stayed up, no bobbling or slumping.At 40 lbs., the crotch strap is in the furthest position, so I could see that being an issue down the road, but for now, it is a very good and comfortable fit for our normal sized, preschool-age kid.",5

A big accident will soak right through (true of every single cloth trainer I\'ve tried, 7 total brands), but it will hold a small accident and slow down the big ones such that only pants need to be changed (i.e. I don\'t have to change his socks and clean the floor).

"994","Britax Pavilion 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx","This is how to choose which Britax cars seat will work for you. It can be confusing and small differences matter.The numbers 55 and 70 indicates maximum weigh of the child. CS means Click and Safe snug harness indicator, G3 is new line with 2 new features:- HUGS new chest pads with safecell technology that are designed to compress in a crash and reduce the amount of impact forces experienced by the child and- EZ easy buckle system that prevents the child from sitting on the buckle when boarding.From the simplest to the most advanced the new G3 models go:Roundabout (up to 55 lb), Marathon, Boulevard, Pavilion and Advocate (all up to 70 lb). First two are the base models and I only considered the Boulevard, Pavilion or Advocate.I chose the Pavilion 70-G3 because has all the features that matter to me (Roundabout and Marathon lacks them, the rest have them);- true side impact protection,- new chest pads that are designed to compress in a crash and reduce the amount of impact forces experience by child,- click and safe snug harness indicator.The Advocate goes further and has a bulky addition in the head area for more safety, but it was too bulky for my VW Tiguan. This the only difference between the Advocate and Pavilion.Boulevard CS doesn\'t have NEW easy buckle system and Boulevard G3 doesn\'t have CS (click and safe snug harness indicator).Overall I rate the this car seat 5 stars. No complaints:- my son loves it, looks comfortable and the middle position is perfect to sit and watch the world through the window and take a nap without his head hanging down,- easy to remove the seat cover ( manufacturer recommends only hand wash, no dryer but it is fine to use washer and line dry),- easy to keep it clean (I wipe it with disinfection clothes and looks great),- approved for air travel, although for me too bulky for plane (infant car seat is more useful for me on the plane and toddlers can just seat on the lap or seat),- made in USA (""with global components""),- they don\'t feel cheap, I compared different brands in the store and liked Britax the most,- seat is very secure, there is no movements I had some with my Chicco Keyfit 30 infant car sear, but this is different base and seat,- my son was never sweaty after a car ride,- easy to install but I wouldn\'t want to switch the car seat between 2 cars, would buy another one,- I bought it for my 1 year old who is big enough to use it forward facing (according to instructions and my judgement), but it is reversible for rear facing, can be used from the birth (obvious minus-can not take sleeping infant with the car seat outside).UPDATE: My son is 2 years old, 30lb and still loves the seat and fits well in it even in the winter coat. After 1 year seat and cover looks like new. The only thing this seat is missing is a cup holder for older toddlers.A second baby is coming soon so I probably will buy a booster type of seat 25/40 lb-120 lb for the older child and younger will inherit this one.",NA

"1008","Philips AVENT BPA Free ISIS iQ Duo Twin Electric Breast Pump, White","I love this pump.  I spent a long time trying to decide between this and the Medela Freestyle, and eventually chose this one.  I based that on the reviews I read, as it seemed this one had less people saying it didn\'t work for them, and since you can\'t return it, it seemed less risky.  I have not actually used the Freestyle, so can\'t truly compare, but I LOVE this pump and am 100% happy with my purchase.The 2 best features of this pump are the memory setting and the power of the motor.  When my daughter was first born, bf\'ing was EXTREMELY painful for me.  ""Sore"" was putting it mildly... as I told my mother I found it infinitely more painful than labor (which in all honestly I did not think was that bad - and I had no drugs).  Given the issues I was experiencing on one side in particular, I ended up only feeding her on one side exclusively while I pumped the ""bad"" side for about a week.  Being able to control the strength and rythem of the pump, to minimize pain, was CRUCIAL for me.  Having this pump allowed me to maintain my supply and I am now still going strong 6 months later.The power of this pump is great.  I also own an Avent Isis Uno (single) pump which I use at home in the morning and there is NO comparison in terms of power.  I can only use the Uno in the morning when I\'m completely full, otherwise I get almost nothing.  The duo , on the other hand, is actually more effective than my daughter feeding directly, and has kept my supply up great.  My daughter ate a lot from 3-6 months before she started with solids ... with this pump I was able to pump over 16oz in only 2 sessions at work, each session taking less than 10 minutes.  Before you have a baby, I know this number means nothing, but trust me this is a lot of milk to pump in such a short time.My only real complaint with this pump WAS that you cannot get spare replacement parts, which is really useful to have at work so you dont have to wash them between sessions (i.e. you can just throw them all in a bag and bring them home to clean at night), but I called the manufacturer today and you actually CAN order spare parts right off the website now, so that is great!!One thing I will say that this motor is very heavy.  If you plan to carry the pump back and forth to work every day, I think it\'s very heavy for that.  This hasn\'t been a problem for me though since I brought it to work once 3 months ago and have left it there since.So in summary -- if you are going to bring it to work and leave it there, or use it regularly at home and don\'t need to carry it around much, you cannot go wrong with this pump.Extremely comfortable & powerful. However, if you can\'t handle high power, you can make it as light as you want with the memory feature.  Highly recommended!!",5

"1011","phil&amp;teds Navigator Buggy Stroller, Cherry","I must say for the price this is a bad choice if you\'re looking for a stroller.1) Few days after purchasing this stroller, all three tires blew up when temperature outside reached over 100F. I guess the walls of the tires are not strong enough to tolerate a slight pressure increase. The position of the air valve is also so bad, that it takes a mechanic to fill them up with air. Did I mentioned that when tires exploded it was a laud bang that scared the crap out of us.2) When collapsing the stroller it happens often that your fingers get caught between two parts of the stroller, many times inflicting serious pain.3) Also, when collapsing the stroller, the handle where you keep your hands 90% of the times hits the ground, not good during mud season, or on public streets where people spit.Actually, if you\'re looking to buy this stroller, I will give you mine for free, that\'s how much I hate it.

We have twins, so we purchased two of them!  The price was pretty good, and the quality seemed like it was constructed well. We really were taken in by the looks and style and it matched our kitchen. The engineering is just dreadful.1. The maneuverability is difficult because it\'s an awkward design with the extended legs. You just can move it quickly or easily.2. Setting it up and storing it takes several steps and one of them sometimes requires repeating over an over because of an internal latch mechanism that doesn\'t always release. It\'s a real pain.3. Cleaning the seats is a chore because you have to remove the straps and speaking of straps...4. Straps are a magnet to babies and these are very long and floppy. We had to use Velcro straps to keep the kids from sucking on them. Also, it would be nice to have a padded shoulder strap so it would prevent the strap from sometimes cutting into the child\'s neck.5. Cracks everywhere!! The top tray and sides are designed in such a way that food will get into every nook and cranny. This drives my wife nuts!We could never recommend this highchair to anyone because it costs too much money to have all of these issues.This is only our opinion and you may not care about any of these things.

"1029","Summer Infant Wide View Digital Color Video Monitor","I love this baby monitor.  I can compare this one to the Motorola MBP36 and I like this one better because the video quality is so much better on this one.  I thought the MBP36 was good until I got this one, then it was absolutely no contest.  In fact, I wish I could return the MBP36.  The MBP36 is good because you can pan the camera remotely using the controls on the monitor and I like that the buttons on the monitor is on the face and not on the edges because that makes it so you are not constantly accidentally pushing buttons when you\'re carrying it, but that\'s it.  In video quality, this one wins hands down and since that\'s the most important part - I prefer this one.  The wide angle is nice because you can see a greater area, but then you\'re not getting a close up.  There\'s a zoom feature which kind of makes up for it but if you are only using this to point into one specific area and want to see like your baby breathing - you may want to get the non-wide  angle version of this baby monitor.  This one is great if you want to monitor the whole crib or a whole room.  If your baby is very mobile, this would be your best choice.  The camera is static (doesn\'t pan), but you won\'t need it to because you can set it up so it shows you the whole room at once.What could be improved:1. Battery life of the monitor - it only lasts a few hours of continuous use.  The charger does have an extra long cable, but it would be nice if the battery life was better.2.  The buttons are all along the edges of the monitor - this is nice because you get a very nice big viewing screen, but not so nice because you\'re constantly accidentally hitting buttons on the thing when you\'re carring it around.3.  Picture quality - Yes, it\'s much better video quality than the Motorola MBP36 and it\'s good enough that you can easily see your baby breathing, but it could always be better....if we\'re being greedy.What is great:1.  Great wide screen so you can see an entire room in one shot.  You don\'t need it to pan.  Screen size is bigger and better than the MBP362.  Great video quality - you can easily watch your baby breathing3.  Great night vision  - you can easily watch baby breathing4.  Very reliable5.  Excellent portability - I have a 1500 sq ft house on a half acre lot and I\'m able to monitor the baby from pretty much my entire property.  So everywhere in the house and out in the yard as well.  Excellent.  It beats the Motorola MBP36 in this area as well.6.  Has an internal antenna which is way nicer than the externa antenna of the Motorola MBP36 - while still having better connection.7.  The stand is better and sturdier on the monitor than the MBP368.  Pretty much everything you need to monitor your baby.9.  The monitor and camera can be closer together before you get feedback - basically, just as long as they are at least 2 feet apart, you won\'t have feedback issues.  Not like the MBP36 which gets feedback if they are in the same room.  This is especially important if you\'re trying to adjust the placement of the camera while looking at the monitor.  Or - if you rig this up in your car to use as a car baby monitor (which I did).  I would recommend using the non-wide screen version if using in the car, but this one would work as well.  I love using this in the car because 1.  It\'s way better than trying to rig up a bunch of mirrors to monitor my baby in her rear facing car seat.  2.  You can\'t see the baby with mirrors if driving at night - but you can with this monitor because of the night vision.  3.  With the zoom feature, you can easily see baby breathing in her car seat - this is especially important with the rise in incidents where babies stop breathing in their car seats.  I am able to drive with confidence and not have to worry because I can totally see her face and chest and know everything is okay.  I have the monitor mounted on my dash with a GPS monitor that accepts a 5&#34; screen.10.  Durability - I\'ve been using this in all different capacities, every day for the past 2 months and it\'s been going strong.  I\'ve dropped the monitor a few times and it\'s gotten scuffed on the edges, but still working great.Great product that I use on a daily basis and am extremely happy with.",5

The only comments I have pertain to the overall appearance of the pump not its capabilities.  When I pulled the bag out of the packaging, all I could think was, wow this bag is huge and super heavy! I was not sure that I wanted such a large carrying case and bulky items to carry around.  So, knowing that I had really liked the appearance of the medela, i bought one to compare with my advent.  The medela is much more compact, much less heavy.  The advent also differed in that one of the pumps could be used manually for the let down as opposed to the medela which had a knob which controls this instead. I must prefer to press a button for let down then to use a hand pump.  Once again, cannot speak for how it actually worked.",3

"1072","Baby Buddy: Baby\'s 1st Toothbrush","I love this product!! My 15 month old is struggling with getting in molars and the side teeth. Her regular teethers don\'t get those hard to reach places. This product does, and it freezes perfectly. I add a little Orajel training toothbrush. Because it is a teether and tooth brush  in one, I put her in bed with it. It relieves the pain while brushing and cleaning her teeth. I love it and so does she. I do freeze it with the Orajel and because it\'s flavored, it allows the orajel to freeze inside the teether, which provides longer lasting pain relief for her swollen sore gums.Now for the ONE THING that makes it a pain in the neck: It\'s small..... be aware that if it gets dropped or misplaced you could very easily spend an afternoon looking for it. This is my third one. I made the decision to buy it yet again simply because I decided that the benefits far outweigh the risk. In the morning, my daughter will throw things on the floor when she gets frustrated to be let out of her crib. Her teether was the only thing small enough that took me forever to find. I\'m not even going to explain what happened to it when the dog ate it.Anyway, this is a simple thing to solve, but only while she isn\'t sleeping. I bought a pacifier clip and attached it to the teether so she couldn\'t lose it somewhere, the dog couldn\'t get it and it didn\'t get misplaced. If she sleeps with the clip, she will stay away pulling at it because she rolls over on her tummy and it pokes her hurting her.",4

"1080","Best Bottom Cloth Diapers - Snap - Orange Sherbet","I turned to cloth diapering when my son was over 7 month old, trying to be a bit more conscientious about the amount of waste we were creating. After hours and nights of researching, friends recommendations and a trial program that included all kinds of diapers, I landed on Best Bottoms and don\'t regret it for one second. I only have this kind of cloth diapers to keep things simple and to stick to what has worked for me. Here is what I\'ve come to love:1) Same diaper from birth until potty training, meaning can become small enough for a newborn and big enough for a 30+ pound baby2) Well made, in the US3) Trim... not bulky. Almost like disposables4) Can reuse the cover if not soiled and keep changing the inserts. This means, I only need 6 covers to be safe... typically use 2 per day and have 18 inserts (6 medium, 12 large)5) Inserts come in different sizes and materials. I use both medium and large (the latter especially at night) and organic cotton and stay dry. I feel that if I mix materials my son has less of a chance to get diaper rash6)  Much fewer layers than other types of cloth diapers seem not to make it too hot for my son7) Can use alongside GroVia disposable/biodegradable inserts when on the go, outside of the house (I\'ve also tried the G Diapers disposable L/XL inserts but did not fit as well and had poor results)8) At night time, I add an Alva baby insert (made of bambu) on top of the Best Bottom large insert. I purchased Alva\'s inserts based on the wonderful reviews and found to work much better for my boy at night than the regular Best Bottom overnight insert. (My son sleeps 12 hours and is a big, big wetter)Along with Best Bottom diapers and inserts, I also use:-GroVia bottom stick to prevent diaper rash-Blueberry cloth wipes (really love these as well). Before these, I was using Viva towels and water in a sprayer/perineal bottle when using disposable. Now, to make sure my son doesn\'t get diaper rash, I add a bit of olive oil and baby cleanser to the water.-BumGenius diaper sprayer (only downside is that pressure is sometimes a bit too much and sprays beyond the diaper),-Allen\'s natural detergent (does a great job) and if any poop stains are left, the sun does the job of &#34;erasing&#34; them... like magic-GroVia disposable inserts-Alva Baby bambu inserts-Kissa\'s antibacterial wetbags (for diaper bag and on the go in case the cover gets soiled)-Ubbi diaper pail and cloth diaper pail liner. Love the pail, but the liner (even the re-designed one) is not doing it for me. I leave the diapers almost dripping to avoid stains, and this liner isn\'t 100% waterproof, so now I put a plastic bag and this liner inside until I find one that works better.",5

Having this Potette is very practical when you are at the park or mall and do not want your child to sit in a public toilet or be uncomfortable because the toilet is too big. My daughter has been using it since I got it and really likes it.  Her only complain every time she sits on it is that \'it hurts.\' It seems to hurt her buttocks a little because it doesn\'t have any padding and she\'s putting all her weight on it. But she is done quickly and happy that she used her \'little potty.\'",4

"1084","Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow","Other reviewers correctly note that this item pills up after the first wash and looks like you\'ve owned it for ages.  It\'s true, but I still can\'t deduct a star because it\'s such a useful item.  My sister-in-law gave me a few and I ended up buying several more.  They\'re just brilliant.I keep one in the diaper bag so if there\'s an accident while changing I can just roll it up and put it in a plastic bag.We have one on top of the pretty changing pad cover (which isn\'t waterproof).  Same deal - accidents just get rolled up and thrown in the laundry.  And you WILL have accidents.We also use them for naked tummy time.  It\'s good to let baby get some air down there and this goes right on top of the playmat.  When she pees on it, just fold over and then replace it if you\'re having more playtime.  Messes don\'t leak through so when you fold it over baby is lying on a dry surface again.FWIW I like the bassinet sized one better than the lap pad.  We have both but the larger one can be used in more places and situations.  This is one of my top 10 baby items.",5
"1085","Bumkins Waterproof Sleeved Bib - On-The-Go","We have a toddler who loves to make a mess - my cousin has nicknamed his eating style as akin to a buzzsaw. So this bib has been a necessity, especially in the winter months when he has long sleeves. it\'s made of a slightly thicker material than the superbibs, but also dries and washes easily. I love that you can pop it in the washing machine to get out the lingering stains, and that it folds compactly for the diaper bag. This is a must-have for us!",5
"1086","Personalized Baby Blanket","I adore this blanket and my friend\'s new baby does too!  It\'s so soft and kept him company in his 6 week stay in the NICU.  All the nurses commented on how soft and cute the blanket was.  The shop seller was also very pleasant to work with.",NA
"1087","Pourty Easy-to-Pour Potty, Blue","After much research, we bought this potty for our 9 month old son, knowing that potty training was just around the corner. I wasn\'t sure what to expect since it was only $14.95 and I was worried about the splash-guard. We haven\'t been able to find a potty with a good splash-guard. This potty has been great! We haven\'t had any problems with any fluids going anywhere except in the potty. And it\'s easy to empty and clean. I love that it\'s only one piece and sturdy so we don\'t have to worry about him tipping over. And the fact that the bowl is smooth means that his little bottom doesn\'t get red marks on it.The one thing that I would say is that it\'s a bit small. My 9 month old sits on it just fine, but even he is going to outgrow it pretty quickly. I\'m not sure if this is just meant to be a very short-term potty. I\'d love to see the company make them just a little bit bigger.Overall, I would still recommend this potty to anyone who is looking for one. :)",5
"1088","Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","I thought the material was flimsy when this first showed up, but had bought it without high expectations.As it turns out, the bag is great. Have been using it for two months with cloth diapers. You could easily fit three (or four in a pinch) soiled diapers. (we use cloth eez newborn size)I have never smelled anything through the bag, even after leaving it in the back of my Jeep with a poop diaper on a hot day. Washes well- I recommend it for day to day use.",5
"1089","Dwinguler Eco-friendly Kids Play Mat - Safari Tour (Large)","This play mat is just what we wanted! It\'s non-toxic, safe and carried no odor with it. It\'s a great thickness so when my little one falls over she doesn\'t get hurt. The polka dots are adorable!! The only downside is that it\'s hard to tuck away (we have a small home), but for all the other things I love about it, it\'s still a 5 star product.  I highly recommend it!",5
"1090","Sesame Street Sesame Street Pullover Bib Set,Girl, 2-Count","Awwww, I adore these bibs.  Honestly, I bought them for much less at WalMart. $5.44 for two.  I have about 12 now and every time my son eats, I use a regular bib, waterproof and then I put this bib over it.  These bibs are really large and catch everything that might fall down a baby\'s lap.  They are just terrycloth and have no other lining but they are great for eating.  My son has dropped everything on them known to man and they don\'t stain, they wash wonderfully and so far, after about 30 washings, they are holding up great!  No piling, no strings coming out, I\'m really impressed!  The neckline is stretchy but does not sag when it\'s put on, it sits in just the right place.  I love these bibs!",5

This gate was the cheapest out of them all, but also the best.  We connected it to our banister with the Kid Co kit so we didn\'t have to drill into the poles.  In fact, we liked the gates so much we replaced the Summer Extra Wide walk through gate from our family room to dining room with yet another Evenflo gate.  Not to mention the wood looks great...and our daughter shakes the gate and tried to climb on it (she is not successful of course...) And it is safe and secure.  I like the way it latches, I don\'t question its safety like I did a few other gates with a little lever securing them.  A++++ I highly recommend it!",5

"1097","Thirsties 3 Pack Boys Fab Doublers Soft Cotton Velour, Ocean Blue/Meadow/White, Large","Buy these! The price is a steal for the quality, softness, and incredible absorption you get!After a much disappointing absorption performance of Joey\'s Bunz Babykicks Hemp Premium Inserts (3-pack in the large - I gave it a ONE star review! If you were considering those, get the Thirsties Hemp Inserts 2-pack Large instead! - Click and see my review -Thirsties Hemp Inserts 2 Pack, Large 18-40 lbs), and pretty much coming to the conclusion that I had paid $21 dollars for a set of Babykicks hemp inserts with the absorptive abilities of a couple sheets of paper towel, I decided to use these (Thirsties 3-pack Girls Doublers) whenever using those awful Babykicks Joeys-Bunz inserts.Eureka! Talk about doublers that are SUPER SOFT and aptly called THIRSTY! They gobble up loads of wetness to keep the little one cozy and dry. I cannot emphasize enough just how soft the cotton velour on these are! Think of the softest fleece you have felt, then you will begin to get the idea BUT SOFTER! They are very durable as well, and you can tell straight out the box, they went the extra mile to ensure top construction. Personally, after trying out several various brands of inserts, doublers, and liners, if I could do it all over again, I would have purchased these thirsties doublers (for overnight use) or for super-extended no change periods these (inside diaper next to baby\'s skin -thin fleece liner recommended option to serve bm\'s barrier) and a Thirsties Hemp InsertThirsties Hemp Inserts 2 Pack, Large 18-40 lbs.As for my 3 Babykicks Joey\'s Bunz Hemp premium inserts, I am tempted to throw them out because they are utterly useless. They aren\'t soft enough to place directly next to baby\'s delicate skin so cannot be used as a liner, and with such limited absorbency (a kitchen sponge absorbs more liquid) that they are useless as a ""doubler"" or any use where soaking up liquid is a must.If i were not as green as I am, these would already be in the trash. Perhaps I can donate them to a seamstress and have them recycled into something of use.Okay, back to the Thirsties 3-pack Doublers! I cannot say enough positive things! Really, get these and do not let the low price trick you! These should be selling for over $15/$20 based on performance alone! They are softer, better constructed and more absorptive than products costing 3 times as much.",5

The pocked in front fits a little extra outfit and bib and the pockets on the side are good for extra empty bottles for formula.  We\'ve been using it for a month now and it\'s in great shape, great buy.",4

"1101","GroVia Newborn All in One Cloth Diaper - Nature","It\'s a cute design. I bought this to try out as my adjustable sized, grow with baby, clothies were much too big for my newborn. His legs looked splayed out all the time and I couldn\'t button his onsies or put 0-3 months pants on over them. This pair solved those problems. It fit well under clothes and I didn\'t feel as if my infant would get some type of hip displacement, but it didn\'t really hold in urine. Soiled diapers didn\'t leak, it was just the mechanics of my son and the way the diaper fit in the front that I had problems with.It does clean up well and the design was cute, but it may be better suited for baby girls. It does take a while to dry.",3

"1104","Leachco Body Bumper Contoured Body Pillow System, Khaki","This pillow is the only thing helping me sleep through the night in my 3rd trimester. I bought it in the middle of my 2nd trimester when I was just starting to toss and turn and haven\'t gone a night without it since. The adjustable wedge is great, I tend to keep it slightly off-center so there\'s enough of the ""c"" shaped back pillow to put between my knees, saving me the need for another pillow. I slept great with this pillow and none others for several weeks, and am now using this pillow and one more between my feet at 35 weeks. I also appreciate that you can flip the wedge up behind the ""c"" and use it as a reclining pillow on the couch now that I\'m on bed rest, and in that position the ""arms"" of the pillow are high enough I think I may be able to use it as a nursing pillow too. We have a sectional sofa and it fits perfect in the reclining position in the corner of the sectional. Well worth the money.UPDATE: I am now using this pillow comfortably to nurse and I fold it on half to prop my feet up to help reduce post-partem leg/foot/ankle swelling. I highly recommend, you more than get your money\'s worth.",5
"1105","Evenflo Classic CustomFlow Silicone Nipples: Medium Flow","Our son doesn\'t like these nipples at all. Not sure why. Every baby is different and I would not give a 2 star review just because our baby doesn\'t like it. However, I don\'t like that there is no way to determine from the nipple, whether you have slow, medium or fast flowing nipples. Heaven forbid you have more than one speed in your home you will be reduced to counting the drips that are coming out of them.Evenflo\'s website is equally unhelpful.  There is no &#34;m&#34; or any other distinguishing mark that I could see, though the nipples are numbered in what appears to be some random fashion.",2
"1106","BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","My baby is a big baby, and was 20lbs at his 4 months check up. so I was only able to use this carrier for 3 short months, definitely not worth the money, considering that the first 3 months the baby should not be going out that much anyways. Too expensive a product for the short like that it has. (it claims to be up to 30 lbs, but after 15 lbs it kills your back) Had I known I would have bought the Ergo with infant insert that goes up to 40 lbs, and can be used as a backpack. I\'m tired of overspending on baby things, so now I got the ergonomic Infantino one to use as a back pack, that is 1/3 of the price of this one, and has way better support for my back.",2
"1107","Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Bear","I am reading the reviews and had to put in my own because we love these.  Now, I did purchase them 2 years ago, so perhaps the quality has changed, but my 4-year old still has to have ""hippo"" in bed every night (my oldest has the elephant and does not use hers much because she is older).  I can tell you that we always use the 30-minute shut-off and we probably only charge hippo once a week.  It lasts for a week without the need to recharge and so we are able to bring it with us when traveling.  I will be sad if the quality has changed because I am hoping to purchase some as a gift, but our experience has been great. It is a hard night light, but that has not stopped our daughter from having it with her in bed. The ability to choose one continuous color is nice since different colors have varying levels of brightness, and also every child has a favorite color.  Based on our experiences, I would recommend this highly.",5
"1108","Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology","Great monitor. No static or interference noise. Sensitive enough that you can hear your child breathing, provided you place the transmitter near the headboard of your kid\'s bed. Set the mic sensitivity to the max setting, and you hear everything -- it transmits constantly in this mode, even if there\'s only ambient noise.Some one-star reviews say the unit turns itself off at night. I don\'t think it does. As a guilty dad, let me offer a hypothesis. I\'m sure none of you other dads have done this, but this is what I did. When we first got the unit, if I was in deep sleep, my response to a loud wail coming out of it was to put my hand on top of the unit for a few seconds, which must have been an instinctive reaction bred of years of smashing the snooze button on my alarm clock. Well, holding down the top button (for 4 seconds continuously) turns the unit off. Once you catch yourself doing this, you\'ll never do it again. If I were Philips, I\'d relocate the power button and recess it a little, so sleeping dads can\'t mistakenly ""snooze"" it. But all in all, I\'d buy this unit again (even with the power button on top) for its great sensitivity and lack of static noise.",NA

"1115","OXO Tot Snack Disk, Green","I\'m a big fan of OXO products and the snack disk was the right choice for me. It\'s great for carrying around small amounts of baby snacks like MumMum. The snacks stayed crunchier for longer periods of time than normal plastic boxes that I had at home, which is one of the big reason why I wanted to purchase this product in the first place. It fits perfectly in a diaper bag (slim, tidy, and trendy) My baby played around with the disk and dropped it out of the stroller several times and the disk popped open into three separate pieces (lid, clear part, bottom part). I didn\'t mind that since the disk was sturdy enough for me to just assemble it back together with ease.Although if you are looking for a snack box for your baby to himself from, I\'m not sure if this is the best choice. I was a little surprised when the product arrived because it was smaller in size than how I imagined it from the sample photograph. It\'s great for small babies because they can hold it well and play with it but I think it might be a tight fit for a older ones.",4

"1119","Safety 1st Alpha Elite 65 Infant Car Seat, Rachel","Got this for my youngest grandson and couldn\'t be happier with it.  Even though this car seat is not a higher end car seat it has features that SHOULD be in the higher end line.  For the price and what you get, you will be very happy with it.It is easy to install and the instruction book is in large print and is easy to read.  Most instruction booklets are useless and you are left to having to figure out yourself.  This booklet has everything that you need in it.  The construction of the seat is excellent and I especially like the extra padding around the head area.  Very nice and secure!  The strap to loosen or tighten is easy to use and does not slip out and does not twist as in some other straps.  Another nice feature is the cup holder which can be removed if not in use.  This will come in handy when my grandson gets older and will be able to take a zippy cup with him in the car.The only drawback and it is a small one is that my grandson can\'t see around the head cushions but this is a minor thing for protection of your little one\'s head in case of an accident.  Love the car seat and it\'s features!",5
"1120","bumGenius One-Size Cloth Diaper Twilight","I am so glad my husband and I decided to try out Bumgenius.  My son is 3 months old and I\'ve loved using them so far.  We used disposable the first couple weeks while we were getting used to being first time parents, but have used bumgenius ever since.  Even if I used these for only 6 months and then threw them away, I\'d still save money, and I would toss one garbage bag instead of hundreds. A few things you might want to know:- We have 24 diapers and I\'m happy with that amount, I do laundry every other day.-It\'s best to have a front-loader washer.  And you really DO need to wash each load twice with an extra rinse cycle.  But that is really not that big of a deal, and up until they start eating solids you don\'t even have to wash off the poo from the diaper before sticking it in the wash.  We do have the diapers sprayer but haven\'t used it yet.-we have a cheap plastic garbage pale next to changing table with a washable diaper pail liner in it.  Just take off the diaper, throw in pail, and dump the whole thing in the wash when it\'s full.  (like I said, this is every other day)-We use gerber washcloths as wipes.  I have a spray bottle with a a mixture that I spray on the washclothes. My son doesn\'t mind at all that the water is not warm.  My mixture is water, a little Dr. Bronners soap, and a tiny bit of tea tree oil, but there are many different mixtures you can use.  just google it.  The washclothes work great and we just put them in with the diapers.-I would recommend the bumgenius odor spray, it seems to makes a difference.  The smell is not that bad though since you\'re constantly washing.-you cannot use diaper creams when using bumgenius,  so I have been using breast milk and it works great! For those not breastfeeding I think you can use olive oil as well.  It\'s gotta be much better for your babies skin anyway.My friend uses the 3.0  all in one on her two year old girl and also loves them.  She uses her diaper sprayer, as I\'m sure we will once my son starts eating solids.  Also, these new bright colors are really fun, I like them better than the old colors. We have some of both.  Overall, I find these to be VERY practical, not nearly as cumbersome as I thought they\'d be.  There is enough guilt that comes along with motherhood... so do yourself a favor and use bumgenius, no need to buy and throw all those hundreds of disposables away!",5

All you do is put a piece of tissue in the chamber so there is no need to buy seperate filters or worry about you getting any of baby\'s not so lovely bodily fluids in your mouth as you suction. It is very easy to clean and since the aspirator doesn\'t go into the baby\'s nose it is much easier for the baby to cooperate with you.It also comes with a mesh pouch that is wonderful for storage and for drying once you have rinsed out the device!

The outside of the backpack looked very worn, as though I\'d washed it with rocks, or about how I\'d expect it to look after a year of use. The color was significantly faded. The lower edge of the flap curled up and, as a consequence, does not stay closed very well. The inside fabric became loose and got runs in it. We were really happy with this backpack - until it got dirty and needed to be washed! I guess I just expected a product for kids to be able to hold up better in the laundry.",3

It was easy to put together, even if it\'s flimsy, and it\'s been sitting in our daughter\'s closet ever since. I can imagine that if I had to move it constantly, it would probably fall apart or something pretty easily. But we just leave it in there, and use the convenient mesh bag that goes inside it when it\'s laundry time, so I don\'t have a problem with the flimsiness of it.

I loved having my own space downstairs to tend to our baby\'s needs without disturbing anyone else. I could turn on lights, watch a short show (to keep me from falling asleep sitting up in the chair), change him while he cried and none of my family woke up.  During the day he slept upstairs in the crib. He is just now growing out of it (4 1/2 months). I highly recommend this portable bassinet.",5

This might be a good thing if you are looking for something to rinse your child\'s head with but it is not ideal for a baby or toddler who likes to fill them up and them dump because my son has gotten quite a lot of water on the floor this way.  He\'s not trying to dump water out of the tub, but he\'s a toddler so it happens a lot.  We used to have a set of the green sprouts stacking cups, which I think were better because they were smaller, limiting the mess factor.

It isn\'t cut to lie flat against the back of her stroller/carseat.  We use it in her convertible carseat and basically just have it sitting in there because the elastic strap on the back is meant for going around something without sides.  We have her in the Evenflo Titan carseat and the Chicco Ct 0.6 (aka Capri) and it doesn\'t work anyway we cut it.  We tried to use it with my 3 year old in her booster but hate having to put her in it with her shoes on (it skeeves me out to have all that dirt/germs going into the inside of this nice bag).  On my 10 month old\'s carseat (she\'s still facing backwards) there\'s too much excess fabric for this to be convenient in any way, form, or fashion.

It looks comfortable when he sits on it. Also, he\'s able to pick up the insert after he\'s done, by himself, and dump it into the toilet. In other words it\'s lightweight and easy to handle. We take it on road trips, and when he has to go he\'ll sit on it inside the car, or on the side of the road, no problems. Plus I think the color\'s kind of neat.",4

The toy was definitely not handled roughly.Taking it apart, I found the problem was that an electrical wire had broken off from the soldering on the battery terminal.  Although it appears the wire gauge is adequate for the voltage involved, this is the thinnest wire I have even seen in a child\'s toy.  I suspect this is the cause of the malfunctioning other reviewers have complained about.It wasn\'t until after buying it that I noticed there is a cancer warning in the fine print.

I love how the seat lays completly flat for when she\'s sleeping or tired. I love how compact it is for a full size stroller... love that it can be back or forward facing... the handle bar is adjustible, AND I\'m able to fold it all the way down so it fits in the trunk of my Acura TL (WITH the seat attached- although it need to be forward facing and fully upright to fit)--it doesn\'t leave a lot of room for other things in my trunk either- BUT- it\'s still pretty compact and no worse than other strollers on the market, but much better than some. My ONLY complaint- there is no cup holder. The one I bought it nice, but sticks out too far so I won\'t even use it for now... I did buy a caddy, and it works good- but then I need to pull the handle up in order to fold the stroller, or else it get\'s stuck. Once compact, I can pushe the handle back down... so, in order to fully fold the stroller, there are a few steps involoved. But for the price, and features... I couldn\'t find anything else like it. Most require the seat to be removed every time or don\'t fully fold down and wouldn\'t fit in my trunk. Overall, I\'m very pleased with this purchase and hope it holds up over the years as my baby is 5mos and very small in the seat- so it should hold her for years to come ;)",NA

"1191","Thirsties Duo Fab Fitted Cloth Diapers, White, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I have searched and searched for a night time diaper for my heavy wetter.  He is almost 9 months old and has soaked through Tiny tush, bummis easy fits, rumparooz, bumgenius, knickernappes, swaddlebees and even disposables(Pampers baby dry)which we resorted to in desperation so we wouldn\'t have to make a middle of the night change of his diaper and clothes.  We even used large and small hemp inserts. I think one of the problems with the aforementioned diapers is that our little boy is a tummy sleeper.  Every time he woke up wet, the front of the diaper would be soaked (and his clothes) and the back of the diaper would still be dry - even the hemp insert.  LOTS of leaks, anywhere from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.  Somehow changing a tired, kicking, screaming baby is not a fun in the middle of the night chore when you\'re deepest desire is to just sleep!  Wet clothes are not fun to get off, and then wiping them while they are getting colder and more and more wide awake so it takes you longer to get them back to sleep....Anyway, back to this diaper.  I bought one to try.  The first night we made it until 5 a.m. pairing it with a thirsties duo wrap.  I was impressed but wanted to make sure it wasn\'t just a light night.  I washed it and dried it again and paired it up with a small sized thirsties hemp insert and the duo wrap again.  No leaks.  Remember the diapers above that were soaked in the front and dry in the back.  The WHOLE diaper was soaked, including the insert! I bought 2 more of these diapers that day.  The only problem we do have is that our 9 month old is fairly big and in 18 month clothing, so most of his jammies are 2 piece.  The diaper is bulky (which is worth it to soak up all the pee) so the top of his jammie bottoms do run over into his diaper and frequently wick wetness.  This is a flaw of the wrap or the operators.  We are also running into problems of trying to make the diaper snug at top, which is making the wrap tight around his thighs leaving awful red marks.  Again this is a wrap or operator problem.  I am going to try some wool wraps and see if that doesn\'t work better for us.This is NOT a diaper by itself, you do HAVE to use a wrap with this.  Again this diaper is somewhat bulky, but I haven\'t found a trim diaper yet that will hold my son\'s urine.  I would not use this diaper during the day time (because of the bulk), but for night time, I think this diaper is perfect.  Also, since you are doing diaper laundry every 2 to 3 days 3 to 4 diapers is enough for over night use.  1 wrap is plenty as it can air dry between uses.  Dry time isn\'t too bad (1 hour), I use dryer balls so that helps to cut the dry time.  Don\'t forget hemp inserts.  I finally settled on large Thirsties hemp inserts and baby kicks joey bunz (large).  Both work equally well.  The thirsties inserts fit better in this diaper.All in all I am more than happy with this diaper.",5

"1197","Simple Wishes Honeysuckle Breastmilk Storage Bags, 25-Count","I first tried the Lansinoh Breastmilk Storage Bags, but I wanted to see what other options were out there.  I had read the Lansinoh bags tended to leak and were thinner, so I was curious to try these bags.  So far I like the thickness of these bags in comparison.  They do feel a bit thicker and more durable.  I have not yet thawed the bags, so if there are leakage issues I will comment later, but so far there have been no leakages with filling them up.  You can tell from the construction of the bags that the seams are also thicker, so I don\'t imagine they will burst as easily.  The width of the seams is probably at least triple that of the Lansinoh bags, which I find comforting.The criticisms I have of these bags are that I am not a fan of the way they tear off at the top.  They tear off in the shape of the nipple outline.  I would rather there not be an outline of the nipple and that they just tear straight across.  As such, I found it slightly harder to peel apart the sides to open up the bag to fill it.  It\'s not difficult, but it is not as easy.  I also found that because of the shape at the top, it is a little more difficult to pour the milk in without hitting the sides at the top.  It\'s not a dealbreaker, but I think if it were just straight and no frills it would be much easier.  I\'m not the type of person that requires the extra cutesy pictures on the bag -- I just want it to work and work well.  Also, I wouldn\'t mind if the seals were distanced slightly more apart so that you can tell when the bag is sealed a little better.  It works and hasn\'t leaked, but I feel like I could mess up the closure during a foggy headed sleepless night.  Other than that, I like the way they stand up pretty well as you are pouring in the milk, and they do freeze flat for spacing issues.I\'m pretty pleased so far with this purchase.  I do wish they were as cheap as the Lansinoh brand, but obviously you are paying for quality over quantity at this point.  If it saves me the trouble of a leaky mess in the future, then I think it is worth it.  I also love the fact that they are oxo-biodegradable.  It makes me feel better to know that they will break down easier in the landfill, since a breastfeeding/pumping mom is probably, on average, going to go through hundreds of these types of bags per baby, and short of using an ice cube tray or something (which is impossible if you\'re going to end up storing hundreds of ounces), there aren\'t many eco-friendly storage bag options out there -- this is the first I have heard about.  That makes this a great product, in my opinion.",4

It was fine for home, but I really did have to be paying attention to him the entire time because he could have easily tipped sideways.  I definitely think it\'s a great product and I would recommend it to other people and I think that my son is now 11 months, walking, and much more stable sitting on furniture that it would work much better.

The way it hooks on the side of the Babysitter is a bit awkward, although I don\'t think it will hurt the baby - one side seems to never fit in the slot.  It might have been better to make a removable toy hanger so you can put your own toys on it?

I had another brand that was not stretchy, and she tolerated it.  However, there was no give, so she would sometimes fall down when it ran out of length.  The Safety 1st has nice stretchy material, so the child can tell when there is no more give and not fall down.  My daughter did not like the material around her wrist, and within a few minutes asked to have it removed.  I have read a recommendation to tie the strap to pant belt loops which is a great idea.  Unfortunately, my daughter does not have pants that have belt loops, so we will work on holding hands and I have ordered a carrier.",2
"1214","Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set","If you\'re trying to breastfeed--and either getting ready for daycare by pumping and filling bottles with mother\'s milk or supplementing with formula--you do not want to get your child these bottles. The baby\'s latch-on and use of the tongue (not gums) to pull down milk supply will not work on these nipples.The only way to get anything out of these bottles (both newborn and the next stage, which I bought to see if it was any better) is to BITE DOWN on the end of the nipple. OW! What Are They Thinking?!?After using a lactation consultant and getting a recommendation to try different nipples, we settled on the Playtex Premium Nurser set with wide-mouth bottles and silicon nipples that were shaped more like real breasts and more flexible like real skin.",1

"1219","Safety 1st Comfy Cushy 3-in-1 Potty Pretty in Pink","This was not the potty I wanted because of the reviews I read, but it was given to me as a gift so we took it and have definitely used it! At 16 months, my daughter needed some lifting to get her positioned right. By age 2 she\'s doing OK.  She always has a red ring on her tushy when she gets up. The cushioned seat is nice, but does stain, and clorox wipes don\'t help. The lid is big so when open, it takes up more room. My daughter has also fallen back on it and it hurts (we have it against a wall...well, as much as the lid will allow). We ended up taking the lid off because of that, so if you get it, I wouldn\'t put it on unless you travel or need it as a step stool.  Others are right in that the urine will go down under the cushion and I agree that it doesn\'t dump very easily (I try to always dump it from the same side so my hands are less likely to get gross). It does the job though & works as a nice step stool for my daughter to help me put laundry in our washer.",4

"1229","BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red","My son is 12 months, but he is pretty small for his age.  We got this particular potty because of all of the reviews by people with young children.  It is a great size for him--He is 29 inches and 20 pounds.  We are just sitting on it several times a day to get him used to it.  He sits on it comfortable and can get on/off easily by himself.  I love that there is no bowl attached for him to take on and off.  I had read reviews about the downside being that it is easy for a child to scoot around on it.  We just got a stick-on non-skid rubber furniture pad and put on the bottom.  It works great to keep him from sliding around on it.  The price is also wonderful.  If you are looking for a simple potty to start a young child on, this is the one.",5

It came quicker than promised and was packaged in a nice clear heavy plastic bag with a handle on it so he could carry it home with him easily.  He absolutely loved it!  The colors are bright and cheery and the dinosaurs aren\'t scary like the more realistic looking ones can be to a young child.  My only complaint is that the comforter was thinner than I expected. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Besides that, everything was great.  It fit his bed with no problems and he was thrilled to get to sleep on his new &#34;dinosaur bed!&#34;",4

I like the white for use with any child and It has stayed white. Has a nice rubber like rim on the bottom that won\'t slide around on my wood floors. Light weight for when I am cleaning bathroom I just pick it up with one hand. May be a little small though for bigger kids with the way it wraps around. Not sure. Will try and update on that later.

My husband had to use leverage and a set of keys to get it to unlatch.However, now that she is in the bassinet portion of the pack n play she absolutely loves it.

I was expecting an extension essentially to my bed with both mine and the baby\'s matress at the same height this is not so. So I still have to pull her out of her bed abd put her in mine to nurse and then wake her up to put her back in.

Instead I use the pillow upside down with my feet around the curved part.

So I had no idea these were ""one-time adjustable"" straps unlike the other models I have seen under this brand. The package comes with 2, I accidentally discovered the permanency while experimenting with the first one. Strap one wasted. The second I fixed to the microwave in what looked like a good position. The strap would not reach to lace all the way through the latch, but it went 1/3 to 1/2 the way so I figured that would be fine. After cinching it closed (permanently), I tried to open the microwave. The strap pulled out of the cinch as quick as could be! Strap 2 now wasted.Very disappointed. I should have read reviews online before purchasing or at least before trying to use them.

Realize that this will mark up your walls, and if your dogs jump on it or your child pulls on it, it will slide and mess up the walls a little bit. Other than that, they are pretty good, solid gates.

"1276","Baby Jogger 2011 City Mini Single Stroller, Black/Black","I just bought the City Mini for my 15-month old after trying the Maclaren Quest and a Bugaboo Frog. I was initially reluctant to buy this one because I thought a Maclaren umbrella style would be more portable. This stroller just WINS. Here\'s why:-Easiest fold out there, even with a baby in your arms. The Bugaboo doesn\'t fold; you have to remove the seat and then fold up the wheels. Who wants to do that every time you go out? And the Maclaren ""One-Handed Fold?"" The one-handed fold ends with the stroller on the ground, so you\'re crouching down with a baby or huge toddler in your arms to pick it up. With the CityMini, you just pick up the center strap and the whole thing collapses.-Amazing sun canopy, biggest I\'ve seen on any stroller. The canopy on the Quest is just terrible. Bugaboo is fine but this is better because it has peekaboo windows for every setting.-Simple adjustable straps. To move them up to the next height level, you just unhook the strap and re-hook it at the next notch. With the Maclaren, you have to thread the straps through the back of the stroller, squeezing their safety latches through the teeny-tiny notches. This can literally take up to an hour. Who has an hour?-Removable seat fabric. You don\'t think this matters until that memorable day when your kid vomits -- not spits up, vomits. The Maclaren fabric DOESN\'T come off; you are stuck spot-cleaning. The Bugaboo fabric comes off but it is a latch system. This is snaps and Velcro, easy as can be.-Really easy to maneuver with one hand. Getting in and out of stores has never been simpler.-User-friendly design. Everything that\'s not obvious on another stroller (seat recline, fold, brake) is just so clear with this one.We got rid of the Quest. Kept the Bugaboo because, admittedly, the wheels and suspension are a big help in these horrible Northeast winters. But until we\'re under six feet of snow, we are a City Mini family!",5

However, it does not work consistently, sometimes the music plays for five minutes, sometimes for one minute, sometimes I get lights sometimes no lights. No matter which setting I choose, it seems to just randomly pick how long to stay on.  It is very unusual for it to play continuously for more than a couple of minutes.  It is fairly heavy and bulky so not worth returning.  If you really want to buy one of these, I\'d get it at a store where you can easily exchange it if the music stops working.",2

We pretty much just re-stick them every night as we\'re drawing the bath.The hoop is a little small for my kiddos to get the ball into, but that\'s helping them learn to aim better, so it\'s not a big deal.The balls are soft enough that it doesn\'t hurt if (when) they throw them at each other. They bounce pretty easily off the walls too so be prepared to chase them around the bathroom!This was one of three bath toy sets I recently bought to replace old toys and this is the one they want to play with the most.",NA

It is easy to put together, all of them look great, it is pretty easy to open as a first time mom and it is so easy to navigate. That really is my favorite thing about the stroller, once you have the wheels in the free-motion mode, it moves,like a dream! Almost like a dancing partner, I know it sounds silly but that\'s the truth! The price at Amazon is the best I found because there\'s no taxes and no shipping if you sign up for Amazon Mom.

It is well made and cute! best of all it buys me an hour or so to do my chores!! your little one will get months of fun from this and because my son loves to jump so much we have purchased the Radio Flyer ""rockin"" pony and the Alexander Trampoline for Xmas/when he outgrowes this.

Some times the container is completely dry, sometimes there\'s 5ml - never more than that.  I think I will stick with pumping after nursing and use this only occasionally. Would be great for those with a large letdown.",4
"1307","Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","I bought this seat for my tall (38in) and thin (28lb) 2 year old daughter. I was impressed with the height the seat allowed for, given that my child will out grow a seat in height long before weight. I needed a seat that would fit in a 2012 Focus and was FAA cerified. The seat is very compact. It was easy to install using the seat belt and the latch. Since the seat is so compact I had enough room to get in the car and put my knee in the seat to help get a solid install. I was able to do this myself in just a few minutes, even in an airport parking lot.My kiddo loved the purple color. That particular color is a micro suede type fabric that is super easy to clean. The wings support her head well when she is sleeping. She can climb in and out of the seat very easily since it is much shorter in rise than her old seat (an Evenflo Symphony). The clips are all great quality and the shoulder pads are nice and soft. She feels less boxed in sitting in this seat. She loves that she can reach things if she drops them next to her seat.I used this seat for air travel shortly after purchase. I found it fairly simple to deal with. I am a 5\'5"" woman with a broader frame. I travelled by myself with two kiddos, 2 and 8 years. We did not check anything, we carried all our luggage on. So that fact that this seat can be carried like a backpack was very helpful.Some tips for air travel with this seat:Get two (2) carry straps for the seat so you can wear it as a backpack. This makes the weight easier to bare, is better for your back and keeps your hands free.Have rubber bands handy to roll up extra strap length. The latch straps are very long and can get in the way when trying to install on the plane.Pros:CompactEasy to install (FF, I have not used it RF)Easy to cleanWeight and Height limitsMulitple (up to 4) cup holders can be usedEasy to carry as a backpack for travelCupholders can be removed and washed in the dishwasher if they get icky.Cons:HeavyCup holders can be removed by child (This has never bothered me.)PriceyOverall this is an awesome seat. I\'d recommend it to all that can afford it.Diono Radian RXT vs. Britax Frontier 85:If you\'re like me your decision has probably come down to these two seats. My daughter rides in both seats. I have the Radian in my vehicle (2012 Focus hatchback). My husband has the Frontier in his vehicle (2009 Vibe). She is equally happy with bith seats.My husband and I are pleased with both seats. We have likes and dislikes for each. I\'ll try to give a good comparision.Seat installation:The Frontier wins here simply because it is lighter.Both seats were super easy to install in either car. The bothe all install well in our 2005 Trailblazer on the odd occassion we use that car. I have never in stalled the Radian RF so I can not comment on that. We use th latch system on both seats. I have also used the belt paths when using in other people\'s cars. Belt path installation is also easy. The Radian is much heavier than the Frontier, making it more difficult to lift.Seat Maitenance:Here I feel the Radian wins.The cover on the Radian is machine washable and is easily removed. The cover is one piece. The straps do have to be unthreaded to remove the cover. The cup holders can be put in the dishwasher.The cover on the Frontier is supposed to be handwashed- not machine washable. Seriously... hand wash something my kid vomited on. Anyway, my washing machine has a handwash cycle so I used that. It turned out fine. Britax sells the cover for $80. The cup holders are intergrated into the seat so you have to wipe them out.Seat adjustments:It\'s a tie. Both seats have to be completely remove from the car to make adjustments.The Radian has straps that need to be rethreaded to adjust. But, it\'s super easy. The crotch strap is easier to move than the Frontier. But, the head wings can be a pain. I have to put my knee in the seat and apply a lot of force to move them. But this means the stay in place once adjusted. When putting a kiddo in the seat the ratchet mechanism to tighten the straps can be annoying. My husband does not care for it.The Frontier has a mechanism on the back that moves the straps and head rest up and dowm. But the adjuster is the piece I always seem to grab when picking up the seat causing the straps to move. I then have to wrangle my daughter to sit in it so I can adjust the straps again. Sort of annoying. Once she is in the seat adjustments are easy. But we didn\'t like the HUGS. They made her sweat under them so we took them off.Seat size:The Radian is much narrower than the Britax. This could make a big difference if you want to fit 3 across a back seat or have a tiny car. Otherwise It does not matter.Travel:I have only used the Radian for air travel. It is easier to bring into an airport, hands down. I wouldn\'t even consider air travel with the Frontier.All in all, either seat is a good pick. It will just depend on your needs. I have found I really like them both and would recommend them equally.",5
"1308","Britax Boulevard 70 CS Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Sophia","We just purchased this seat for our second child. We had the older version for our first child.  They have made several really nice improvements for this new model. The cover comes off easily and can be removed without taking the seat out of the car. The base is nicer - seems not to dig into the leather car seat as much and has latches for holding the attachment points if you wanted to travel with it and not have buckles and straps swinging around.  The fabric is plush but also seems to stay cleaner.  Overall, a nice improvement to an already great seat.",NA

"1314","VTech - Learn &amp; Dance Interactive Zoo","I wasn\'t all that crazy about this toy when I first brought it home, but my then 3.5 month old thought differently.  Now at 4 months, this is his consistent favorite.  He has lots of toys but this one always holds his attention the longest.  The toy makes many different sounds: animal noises, beeps, songs with both words and melodies and more.  There is a flashing yellow light.  But, what he seems to especially like is the little dancing monkey.  He isn\'t old enough to play with the toy himself, of course, but he reaches out all the time to try to spin the little wheel and touch the monkey or the lever that makes him move.  He stares at it and smiles for a really long time whenever we play with it together.  I highly recommend for young babies during tummy time.",5

Our daughter loves the globe, not to mention the lights and sounds.  She didn\'t like to swing forward to backward until she was about 3 months but it didn\'t matter, she loves this swing and never cries in it.  I have also found that if your baby is congested your pediatrician may recommend allowing your baby to sleep in this till they are well (this saved us quite a few sleepless nights).  I can\'t say enough of positive things about this swing.  I know many people who have them and none of them have any complaints either.

"1324","Lifenest Sleep System","I am so dissappointed in this product. I was having problems with my baby spitting up, so I was letting him sleep in his swing. I found this mattress and thought it was the absolute perfect solution. WRONG....He was two months old when I got this and already moving around...doing 180\'s in the crib and hated being swaddled. I bought this...even at an eye popping $150..because of the incline. I thought it would be perfect. NOPE....he slid off of the mattress. He moved a little and then started rolling down the mattress until his neck was bent up against the rails and the mattress....it was a terrifying sight. There are instructions to help solve this problem. You put towels underneath the mattress to make it level so the slant is gone. Well...that didn\'t help with the spit up problem and now it gives the baby now a HUGE drop if he does wiggle and fall off the mattress. Then there is the issue of spit up. You have to buy sheets for the thing which are $50 a piece. It comes with one...but the mesh on the sheet holds all the liquid in so after a bit the sheet smells like rancid sour milk. So...I was having to wash these sheets on a daily basis..sometimes twice. They were so expensive I only had one extra sheet. So...in summary... I spent over $200 for a mattress that now sits in a corner and didn\'t work AT ALL. If you have a newborn that doesn\'t move, it will be great...but once the child starts moving...get ready to be terrified waiting for your child to roll or fall off this mattress. Maybe others had a great experience, but I did not. I can\'t imagine that I have the only baby that moves a lot. If you\'re baby moves....don\'t waste your money!",NA

"1330","Munchkin Travel Booster Seat","I agree with other reviewers who\'ve complained about the lap restraint.There is just not enough length in the t-strap.  I\'ve uploaded a picture showing just how short it is.The seat has 4 non-slip feet that tuck into the base.  They are covered with velcro flaps that also have non-slip pads at the corners so you can use it in a booth too, which is nice.There\'s not a ton of storage room, but you can certainly fit diapers, a slim wipes case, a cup and some utensils.  Depending on your priorities it could even hold a small coloring book and crayons.Its straps are doubly looped, so it\'s a minor pain to adjust but once you get it set it\'s good and snug and won\'t slip loose.I sent the link to my mom for us to have one for my daughter (20mths) at her house, but she ordered an addition one for my nephew (3yrs) and it\'s worked great for him as well.

However, the bar is adjustable for those who don\'t need the extra height.Another nice feature is the adjustable seat safety bar which I haven\'t seen on other strollers.  My toddler loves holding onto it.My personal favorite features are the multiple storage compartments and the smooth ride.  This stroller is wonderful for jogging, walking, exercising, and trips to the beach or zoo.  However, as others have said, it isn\'t ideal for trips to the mall.

It\'s especially not fun when it\'s 3 a.m. in the morning, baby is crying and I\'m half asleep. When I got this bottle warmer our world improved greatly. Both my husband and I can\'t imagine not having this bottle warmer. It steams the bottle up quickly and evenly. I usually pre-measured the water and have it ready for the next feeding.

I understand it\'s hard to use it for back carries because of the padding and it does slide a little when I\'m using it because of the padding, but I still would buy it again. Regarding size, I\'m 5\'6&#34; and 210 lbs and I got a large and have a fairly decent tail, down to above my knees, which I like.

The minute I placed him down on the mat he loved the mirror and when his little foot found the key board, he took off kicking away. I really like the fact that I can hear him kicking away when my back is turned so I know he is alright. In the last 2 weeks he has started smiling and I get a big gummy smile and a giggle when I put him down , I can see this play may being one of his fav things for a while yet.

It took a good 2 weeks to go away. I make a point to avoid excess chemicals in my home and especially around my baby (he was already born when we set up the crib), so that was upsetting.The other thing is the changer part is TOO SHORT. My son is only four months old now and I have to constantly be vigilant to make sure he doesn\'t fit his head or feet on the wood. Also, forget trying to find a pad that will fit--you won\'t be able to. I\'ve looked EVERYWHERE. So we\'re stuck using the crappy pad that came with it, which as a newborn he hated so we ended up using the bed anyway.Would not purchase again.

I\'m able to fit this seat in the center of my Camry with two Graco Turbo Booster seats on either side.  There are two clips you need to thread the seat belt through, making it a little more time-consuming and tricky to buckle than a standard booster seat and your child needs to be able to sit still and straight on their own (there is so side support), which is why I suggest this for occasional use rather than every day use.",4

"1347","Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station","I received this as a shower gift and thought it was fabulous until I actually began to use it.  For the first couple of months I used the sling however, when my son began to get active, he would kick at the water so much that the sling wouldn\'t stay clipped in.  Once he was able to sit, I began to use the ring.  I discontinued use of it soon after because the ring actually cut his stomach when he leaned over the ring to grab his rubber ducky.  He is very chunky. A 20 lb, breastfed, 5 month old.  So I think that his stomach got pinched between his legs and the ring, and when he turned his body, it gave him a scratch.  I realized then that the underneath of the plastic ring is very rough and seems a bit sharp as well.  It also leaked the entire time, but wasn\'t too big a deal for me being that I used it in the tub anyway.  And I WAS locking it during each use.  Now that he is able to hold his head up, I just use my bath tub.  He seems to enjoy it more anyway.",NA

"1352","Nuby Jiggle Giggle Butterfly Vibrating Teether","We had purchased a few different vibrating teethers in the past but none of them allowed me to change the battery so although they were LESS expensive than this teether, how much was it really costing me in the long run to buy a NEW teether every few months when the battery died? I love that you can replace the battery in this one! Worth the additional cost in my opinion. My 6 month old picked up on how to make it vibrate on his own the first day we had it after showing him ONCE which side vibrated! He is now 8 months old and chews on this daily (2 teeth in so far with 4 more on their way and he barely fusses with them - just crawls over and picks this up). He doesn\'t use the cool gel side much on this but he has other gel teethers also. He absolutely loves the vibration of this which is why we picked it anyway! :)",5

"1354","Valco Baby Mama Bag , Brilliant Black","We\'ve been using the Valco for a little over a year now and I love it!  From the air filled wheels to the light frame and turn on a dime steering, the Valco is a winner.  It isn\'t cheap, but do the math for yourself and figure out if purchasing it and accessories is a better bargain than buying a pram, single, double, and jogging stroller.A lot of my friends have Phil and Ted\'s and I looked at those too. But the Valco seemed like you could have more than one kid on it at a time and not have to put the second one underneath, where the basket normally goes.  The Phil and Ted made me nervous with little fingers so close to the wheels.  With the Valco kid no. 1 moves to the toddler seat on the front where they can see everything and kid no. 2 stays in the main seat. I have only used the Valco for one child so far, so I can\'t say if there are any drawbacks to the toddler seat or hitchhiker bar.What really sold me on the Valco was the bassinet attachment and the zip in sun shade/bug net.  Granted, neither of these come standard- they are both additional purchases- but they were worth the money in my book.The bassinet was perfect as I had a late winter baby.  I could put her in the bassinet inside the house and carry her out to the waiting base.  She was snug and safe and warm and I didn\'t have to worry about the elements with the hood and rain cover.Another plus was that she could really stretch out and have a good nap.  Her head wasn\'t lolling to the side and she was not all crunched up in a half sitting position.  If she was asleep at the end of the walk, I just popped off the bassinet and carried it into the house without waking her at all.  The only thing I did not like about the bassinet was the cheesy prop-up option.  I guess they put it in there so that an older baby could be propped up to see out, but if your baby is old enough to do that, wouldn\'t you switch over to the regular stroller sling?The sun shade is not something you use every day- but it is well thought out and functions beautifully.  It zips into the hood on the stroller and clips underneath the footrest with a toggle.  That means those toddler feet can\'t kick it off and little hands can\'t pull it down to play peek-a -boo.  It is a really fine mesh unlike a lot of the other sun shades and that means that your child can see everything.  It is a little hard to see in, but there is a handy window on the top of the hood so you can look down while pushing the stroller.The only drawback, you can\'t use the sun shade with the toddler seat.  I guess I\'ll have to see if I can use another shade like the protect-a-bub when I have more than one.Over all - I am very glad I got the Valco.  I would buy it again.",5

I have to admit that once I placed the order I was a bit skeptical if Kaboost would really be easy to use, fit my chair and also be stable. But I have to say, that this product really does live up to its name. It snapped onto my chair in seconds and even stays attached when the chair is moved. It even makes the chair more stable and my son climbs in and out of the chair by himself and feels just like everyone else. I highly recommend this product, it is truly brilliant.",5
"1367","The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","It is a nice stroller for shopping and other indoor activities. We have red/black version. It folds fairly easily, has a parent tray. The basket underneath is pretty much useless, maybe you can squeeze a baby jacket in there. We have a large canvas bag with a single wide shoulder strap that hangs over the bars kind of in the way diaper bags are usually attached to strollers, and fits diaper bag plus other stuff.There was a bunch of these strollers on Amazon, with slightly varying prices. As I found out later, the difference is not only in color. Some of the strollers are newer models and have some improvements compared to the red and black model which is older. For example, newer ones have a cup holder, shoulder strap to carry the stroller. We don\'t. So research before you buy. No regrets for us - we like the red color for our baby girl.",4

They are thin but that\'s what I wanted. Very soft.The ones I ordered from Amazon are poorly stitched to the point that the stitching is actually coming loose from the fabric.

DO NOT wash them in the dishwasher.  I usually use Seventh Generation soap to hand wash the plastic stuff to be safe (unscented).  However, I was lazy when these came in and tossed them in the dishwasher with the Cascade dishwasher tabs.  Now they smell like Cascade and water tastes like Cascade.  I\'m guessing it will take a while for the silicone and plastic to give up that nasty taste.  It really observes the soap odor.  Also, the lid is a little sticky screwing on - it could be better.",NA

"1371","Safety 1st Saunter Travel System, Stratosphere","My daughter outgrew this seat at 5 months old and 17 lbs. it was uncomfortable for her for a whole before. She\'s not excessively chunky but is chubby like babies this age should be.Taking the seat out of the base, and licking it into place took some practice. The stroller doesn\'t roll as well as the graco (from a travel system) that was given to us to use at my moms. Just dorsnt roll straight. Love my double cup holders, cubby, basket (our miniature poodle rides in it sometimes). The recline feature works and when used with car seat the sun shades match up to provide maximum protection for you baby. The crutch clasp in the car seat is a big old pain in the butt, but I was in love with the print so I dealt with it. Adjusting the shoulder and crutch straps in the car seat is relatively easy but they need to give you more length to work with for adjusting, lo wasn\'t squished length wise or width wise, just in the straps. The basket on the stroller is very difficult to access when seat is reclined.... And it is necessary to recline the seat to use with the car seat. It folds up very easily... Easier than the graco. Overall it is a decent package, but others may suit your needs better.",3

"1376","Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo","I was recommended to get a walker or doorway jumper by friends, whose babies had loved them. However, upon further research I found that those toys were some of the most dangerous on the market. But I loved the idea of a toy that encouraged physical activity. I came across jumperoos while searching on amazon.I found a used rainforest jumperoo for half price with only the motion sensing toy still attached. I tied wood toys to the other slots, and my 5 month baby loves it. She loves the cause-and-effect from the motion sensing toy, and loves being able to jump. I love that it keeps her occupied for a bit while I do things that don\'t allow me to hold her, like cooking on the stove.The music it plays is nice. I wish I knew the names of all 4 songs it plays in continuous music mode so I could sing along. The first is ""Froggy Went A-Courtin\'"" and the third is ""The Itsy-Bitsy Spider"", but I don\'t know the other two. I was concerned that it was treated with flame retardants because of a notice on the tags, but I called the company and Mattel said none of the Fisher Price toys are treated with flame-retardant, including this one.The main downside is that it is bulky in our small house, but I don\'t see how it could be any smaller and still allow for jumping. The other thing I don\'t like about it is the annoying elephant noise.",5

However, it slips and slides and doesn\'t stay put over the chair.  Most of the time, the velco doesn\'t work because the chairs have wood rails blocking it.

"1391","UPPAbaby Vista Stroller, Red/Denny","I generally do not leave product reviews, but I felt that it was important to write a review for this stroller. Here\'s why: I live in a big city, with enough rain, and plenty of uneven side walks/hills. This stroller is definitely for babies in the urban jungle. If I lived out in the ""burbs,"" I would not have purchased this stroller.Pros:-Comes with a bassinet and a seat that can be reclined (#3 position) for a newborn.The basket is large (fits ~2-3 large paper grocery bags), and is spring loaded so that you can easily access it when using the bassinet.  Although if you are planning on going grocery shopping, I recommend using the seat and not the bassinet. The basket is much easier to access when using the seat attachment.-Comes complete with a rain cover and sunshades/mosquito netting. The rain cover is very well designed. It has a peekaboo window for light rain. The other day, I had to walk home for 15 minuted in the pouring rain. My baby was 100% dry under the rain cover. My bags in the stroller basket were only slightly damp. I was able to stay dry since the stroller can be easily maneuvered with one hand (even on uneven pavement) when you\'re holding an umbrella with the other hand.-The canopy is large and is very easy to attach or remove. The peekaboo window on the canopy is also large.-The wheels are large and the stroller handles very well on uneven/bumpy side walks/light rail tracks. As I previously mentioned, it can be easily pushed with one hand.-The break works very well, even on hilly terrain.-The 5 point harness on the seat is very easy to adjust.-The handle bar can be opened only on one side to take the child out of the stroller, so you do not need to removed the handle bar completely.Cons:-This stroller is heavier than my Baby Jogger City Mini. I am able to carry both the bassinet or seat plus the stroller frame and the baby, but the everything put together weighs over 30 lbs. So, unless your building has an elevator or you live on the first or second floor, I would not recommend purchasing this stroller if you\'re going to lug it 5 flights of stairs every single time.-There\'s no rain cover for the bassinet. If it\'s raining, I have to use the seat attachment. There\'s nothing wrong with using the seat attachment, but it  would have been nice to have the option of using the bassinet if the weather forecast predicts rain.-The stroller frame can only be folded with two hands. This mean that it I want to take the bus or the light rail, I have to detach the seat or the bassinet first, put in on the ground, then fold the frame with both hands. If I\'m traveling with another person, then it\'s not a big deal; but when you\'re going somewhere by yourself with the baby, the two hand fold can become an issue. The stroller can be unfolded using only one hand.I guess that this would be the issue with many other strollers as well.Oh, and please go to Kiwi Kids to get your stroller.  They have amazing customer service and great deals on strollers/gear. The initial frame for the Vista was jamming and was really difficult to fold.  I received a replacement frame within 24 hours (granted I live in the area) which worked folds easily.",5

The city on the reverse is a great mat to teach her some words that are written on the buildings and street signs. The material with which it is made up from is fine with us as it is also another sensory material. Not soft but not to rough. It\'s one of those texture you would find in the Baby/ Toddler portion of children museums. It has a soft padding that makes it comfortable to sit on. I wouldn\'t mind using it for our future baby bec I believe in introducing different kinds of sensory materials and this mat is one of them.

"1406","JL Childress Wheelie Car Seat Travel Bag, Black","Have only used this for one flight so far so this short review won\'t really be of much use for someone interested in the durability of the item or wear-and-tear after long use, but figured I\'d go ahead and write up a little something anyway.I used this item to protect my baby\'s infant Graco Snugride carseat and base.  It fit perfectly! (note: it won\'t fit perfectly if you have the car seat attached to the base, you\'ll have to seperate the car seat from the base but that\'s easy!)It held up for that flight, both wheels are still intact, the outside material wasn\'t marked or ripped, the zipper still works, and the strap is still attached.  But as I said, I\'ve only used this for one flight so far.It is a bit awkward rolling it around an airport.  I flew from a small airport into another small airport and so I didn\'t have to do much walking at all, but it was a little tricky sometimes getting the bag to maneouver in the directon that I wanted to go.  I think the problem is that there is just one small design flaw- the strap you hold to wheel it behind is a tad short.  It seems to work well when it\'s tipped lower towards the ground when you\'re wheeling it behind you but the short strap didn\'t allow me to do that very easily, so if the strap were just a big longer, it would have been perfect.  I can easily make something here at home to make it longer though, and I\'m sure just about anyone would be able to do the same, but I still voted 4 stars instead of 5 because in my opinion, you shouldn\'t have to rig something up yourself to make a product work better, that should be part of the design to begin with.I would still recommend this product though- as I said, it served it\'s purpose.  It arrived to my destination all in one piece and so did the most important thing, the carseat inside that I was tryin to protect. (again though, how well this product DOES or DOES NOT work I think also depends greatly on the luggage handlers who load and unload the planes- no product is going to survive if the people unloading are throwing things carelessly and nearly every product is going to survive if they are being unloaded in a more careful manner.)",4

The picture quality is horrible, so much so that I could only tell where my baby was by his black hair! His body blended in with the background of the sheet.

"1421","Safety 1st: Rockin\' Jitter Buggy","I was so excited when I put this together for my son.  He has played in the Baby Einstein exersaucer and was thrilled with everything!  I placed him in the Jitter Buggy and he bounced a bit, then stared at me.  Nothing in it really captures his attention.  I want him to explore, I don\'t want to have to do it for him!  The sounds can only happen one at a time, which is a major flaw to me, because out of the ""11 toys to entertain baby"", 4 of them are the sound making toys hooked up to the D batteries. (The cell phone has sounds and it\'s own battery pack, but it just plain sucks. The company counts the 3 cars on a wire as 3 separate toys, as well as 2 mirrors.)  So, if the radio is playing, he has to wait before anything else makes a sound (or it cuts off the radio).Here is what I liked about the Jitter Buggy:1.  Great idea for an exersaucer2.  The turn signals, vibrations and horn are cool3.  The bouncing is very entertaining to baby!Here is what I don\'t like about the Jitter Buggy1.  Poorly thought out anf constructed; it could have been so much cooler and educational.2.  Not enough stimulating toys to capture baby\'s interest for more than a couple of minutes.3.  From seat to floor of toy is almost too tall...My baby is in the 50th percentile for his age 27"" at 5 months, but he is on his toes!  The seat adjuster is all the way out!  Max height is 32"" on this toy.4.  Seat is too wide and doesn\'t spin freely.  Once again, I had to spin him.I was just very disappointed in this, and I am returning it for the Graco Baby Einstein exersaucer.",2

We got this in hopes that it would keep his head from turning while he is in his car seat, bouncy seat, etc.  Not only does it serve that purpose excellently, it also is apparently very comfortable, because he sleeps so peacefully on it!  As soon as I put him down on it in his bouncy for nap time, he is asleep within seconds. I am thinking of purchasing a second one just so we don\'t have to move it back and forth from his car seat!",5
"1439","Primo 4-In-1 Soft Seat Toilet Trainer and Step Stool White with Pastel Blue Seat","I agree with the other reviewers that this potty chair has too many parts and crevices/corners to clean and to re-assemble the removeable seat after child has played with it is a bear.  The blue cushion removes fairly easily from the white plastic and the tabs do not hold it in very well; personally I think it should be welded or molded with the plastic part, not sure why they are separate in the first place since you would always remove the whole seat.  The handles on the side are kind of flimsy and the step stool moves a lot all over the bathroom tile floor, needs rubber stoppers.  It is especially a problem when you use it as a step stool for the toilet.  My 2.5 y/o son was kicking it with one foot while his other foot was trying to get on the stool (could be he\'s clumsier than other toddlers too), so I have to hold him and the potty/step stool in order to get him stable on it before helping him pull down his pants.  Lastly, the molded blue ""bump"" in front does nothing to shield the pee in my son is sitting on it - I\'ve gotten sprayed several times, even after I\'ve helped him tuck his ""faucet"" down below and behind the bump.All in all, it\'s not bad, lasted through a few years as I trained my daughter -who\'s 5 now- on it as well.  If I was to do it again, I would probably look for a potty chair that has something for child to hold on to while he/she is trying to sit down.  So many times my son (and probably my daughter did too) ended up with his bottom on the floor, b/c he couldn\'t see the potty and missed or he accidentally pushed the potty a little and it easily slid over.  Amusing to watch, but counter-productive to potty training...",4

I can clearly see my baby\'s face & can see if her eyes are open or closed & she does not look distorted.-Really clear day color day picture!-Crystal clear sound, no interference-Zoom works quickly & looks clear, a little grainy but not distorted-Pan works great too-Nice and basic, very easy to use-I like the light bar that indicates sound from green to red, red being loud cries. This is handy when I turn the sound off so I can still monitor her visually.Cons:-In portable mode, I wish the video would come back on if there are sounds in the orange/red category. ( the video turns off only after a minute only in portable mode, which I only use durin naps. At night I use it plugged in, in which the video stays on).This is a personal preference & NOT a deal breaker & you just have to tap the video on button to turn it back on again & again itll shut off after a minute to conserve battery. Also the sound stays on.-I wish instead of the display saying &#34;Cam1&#34; it displayed the temperature. Again not a deal breaker & that\'s handy if using multiple cameras.-THe power on button is tricky.

This thing clips onto the Papasan perfectly and serves as a great kick toy for her...but I can see (as the other parents report) that it isn\'t going to be long before it gets knocked over with stronger kicking. I also like it as a toy over her Arm\'s Reach Mini CoSleeper and on the Dex 3-in-1 Travel Genie. I agree with the other parents about attaching it to car seats, though...doesn\'t work. For that, I use another Tiny Love product that mesmerises my daughter completely...the Clip and Go Mobile.

"1456","Safety 1st Perfect Fit Gate","I LOVE this gate by safety 1st. No assembly required; that is unless you want to mount the gate to the wall, and very easy to use for adults! Everyone I invite into our house has commented on this gate on how nice it looks, and I also recommend it to everyone who has kids and want a replacement for that old flimsy wooden gate. Right off the bat I applied this gate to our hallway and I noticed how great the auto fit feature was, all you have to do is pull up on the handle, adjust, and then push down the handle, and it applies pressure to the walls. Also it has an adjuster on the one side of the gate which adjusts to doorways that have trim on the bottom which I though was brilliant. The rubber end pieces do a great job of ""holding"" to the walls too. There is no climbing on this gate either as it the whole gate is a solid piece, so that way kids can\'t use toe-hold to climb.Installing the gate to the wall takes a few glimpses at the instructions, Safety 1st tries to make installing as easy as possible for you. Along with the gate will come a few hinges and when you install the hinges safety 1st gives 2 detailed slips of paper that you use to find your measurements without measuring. All you have to do is poke your pencil through the paper to make a mark where they indicate you to screw the hinges on the wall and voila! Your done. Easy as pie.I gave this product a 5 out of 5 as I feel like my money was well spent and because of the durability, quality, ease of use, and effectiveness this safety gate provided, as I received more out of this gate as I expected and was impressed greatly.",5

"1470","Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile","Along with the LOOK,LOOK! book, this item is a must for all infants. Placed in the bassinet from birth, it can help your child\'s brain and eyes develop normally. Items such as this helped create a miracle in my child\'s vision, in that she was supposed to be blind. I did not know this at the time, and later learned of her visual defects (nostagmus nerve blockage syndrome and weak eye muscles). I had visual stimulation for her as a newborn like this mobile, as well as intervention from many health professionals, all which helped her to develop her retinas and ""rewire"" her brain.",5

We had to fold the Bummis length-wise to get them to fit our BumGenius 3.0 and 4.0s on my 9-month-old. The CuteyBaby fit width-wise, are softer, and tear so much more easily from the roll than the Bummis. I haven\'t had a problem with them clogging the toilet. I like that they come in a 6-pack because we use one at every change.With a 4-year-old in the house, I\'m not brave enough to install a diaper sprayer in our bathroom.",NA

How does Amazon expect us to assemble this without the hardware? I\'ve heard great reviews about this product and I\'m throughly disappointed. Regardless of how the product may/may not function, it\'s just a huge inconvenience that I now have to contact Amazon, wait (again) for second package to come with hardware, and wait to assemble something that I should already be sitting in. I hope Amazon will take care of this issue promptly because I am currently not satisfied with the fact that I had to pay for a product and not have all the parts. Also, there is no guarantee that Amazon will send us the parts. This is really disappointing.",2
"1475","Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set","I\'ve used these bottles since my sons were born.-I love the fact that they are extremely easy to clean and the liners are very convenient.

I had a mess of formula everywhere!!!",3
"1476","Fisher-Price Musical Mobile, Rainforest Peek-a-Boo Leaves","We wanted a mobile that had bright popping color, which was harder to find than we first imagined it would be. The Fisher Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical Mobile fit the bill and included some features we really find noteworthy.As this mobile rotates, the leaves flap up and down like wings on a bird. As the fauna spins underneath, the leaves drop down in the gap between each character, lifting back up and out of the way as the next animal approaches. This really seems to grab our 2 month old\'s attention and I consider it the mobile\'s most unique feature.The remote is handy for undisturbed restarts, allowing us to reset the music when it times out if she is still awake.The music is nice and plays at a very appropriate volume just as noted by many other reviewers. While my wife and I prefer the Baby Einstein product lines take on some of the classical composers, our baby seems to be soothed to sleep by the Fisher Price interpretations just fine. This was the one reason we gave the mobile 4 stars instead of 5. As far as functionality and effectiveness we are very pleased, just would have preferred slightly different musical choices.The unit attached to our crib without issue and assembly was straight forward and completed quickly.",4

"1478","Mother\'s Milkmate Breast Milk Storage Rack (10 Bottles)","These are great little bottles and a super system for storing your breastmilk!  The only drawback is that I\'ve had some of the lids crack when I\'ve dropped them (NO MILK LEAKED THOUGH!) and you can\'t purchase lids separately.Update: I\'ve been exclusively pumping for 6 months and these are the first bottles I reach for, above Medela & Evenflo.  The Evenflo plastic bottles leak when you shake up the milk and the Medela bottles don\'t fit into the storage rack that I love.  Also, the customer service is GREAT!  I emailed them about a couple of my lids breaking due to dropping the bottles and she mailed them to me free of charge!The inner seal keeps milk from leaking and the storage rack really keeps my milk organized.  For about 3 weeks, I\'ve been without lids and having to resort to other bottles and I hated it!  My lids came in the mail yesterday and Mother\'s Milkmate bottles will again be my bottle of use.",5

I gave them two stars for a few different reasons.My daughter has very sensitive skin and I need to use diaper cream on her every time I change her.  Even using two sheets, folded, the paste still leaks through to the diaper sometimes.  A big bummer when using cloth diapers as you have to spend extra time scrubbing to get the paste out.The price seems cheaper than the others - 200 sheets for the same price as 100 sheets - but I end up using two at a time.

After reading many reviews, O was really concerned that he was going to brake the lights on it and hurt himself. But when we got the jeep in, the lights are actually very sturdy. It\'s such a cool walker for a little boy. It\'s almost a cute prop for capturing photos of him. It is very easy to put together. It took him just a few days to figure out that he can actually take off in it. He walked backwards first. We also bought him a baby einstein jumper, thinking we would just get a bouncer jumper, or a walker but they both do different things. First child! What can I say. We\'d buy anything to see him smile.",5

I bought it to make sure my dog uses her doggy door and goes outside instead of in the basement.  The control to move the camera 180 degrees and up and down is wonderful.  I get some interference if I\'m on the phone which is no biggy.  I have noticed that sometimes when I turn it on (every great once in awhile) that all I get is snow.  so I do have to go downstairs to turn the camera power off and then back on but again no biggy compared to how much less frustration I have with it vs. without it.

"1487","Dr. Brown\'s 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","We\'ve been using these since my son was 3 days old and have never had a problem with spitting up or excessive gas pain. I received a set of 3 at my baby shower (I hadn\'t even registered for them). During the first couple of days my son was home, we were still using the pre-filled Enfamil bottles from the hospital. Every time I laid my son down, he got fussy. I could burp him &amp; he\'d be fine for a while but it just seemed like he had to be burped all the time. We started using the Dr. Brown bottles and could tell a difference immediately.Yes, they are a little more time-consuming to clean but having a happy baby is well worth the effort. A dishwasher basket helps a lot with the cleaning. I just throw the collar &amp; insert into the bottom of the basket, put the nipples on the top of the basket (which is designed to hold nipples) and put the stem part in the silverware basket.The only problem I have is with the way they\'re packaged. The 8 oz Wide Neck should be sold with EITHER Level 1 or Level 2 nipples. We just bought another 3 pack AND had to spend an additional $4.00 on Level 2 nipples for them - the Level 1 that came with the bottle are basically worthless to us now. That\'s the only reason I\'d rate this product as a 4 instead of a 5.",4

"1494","Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail","I have two 11-lb cats who rebel if their litter box is not clean, but that meant that I had to keep a bunch of the small grocery bags around to dispose of the dirty kitty litter. I\'ve been trying to be more environmentally conscientious, so I wanted to find a way to NOT have to use as many plastic bags (and get back to using my reusable shopping bags).I was going to buy one of the kitty litter pail, but I didn\'t like the idea of having to buy the proprietary refills, so I read some of the reviews and decided to buy this diaper pail instead.Here is how I use it:- I use an 8-gallon trash bags - not a grocery store bag - because the regular grocery store bags are too small and too thin, meaning that I would have to use multiple bags to prevent it from accidentally tearing. The 8-gallon trash bags fit perfectly and stay in place after you snap the lid onto the diaper pail.- I empty it every 5 days (again, I have two 11-lb cats). Even though the bag at this point is only about 1/3 full, it is heavy, and I don\'t want to take a chance of the bag tearing.- Instead of a nursery freshener, I followed the advice of another reviewer: I put baking soda in a coffee filter and put the coffee filter in the freshener slot that exists in the inside of the lidI saw that some of the reviewers think that the lid doesn\'t raise high enough when you step on the pedal, but I don\'t share that opinion because mine opens about 60 degrees and that is enough for me.This diaper pail stays near the litter-box (for ease of access when cleaning the litter-box) in a small half-bathroom. It doesn\'t take up much space, and you cannot smell the dirty kitty litter (unless you open the lid, of course), which is important to me because this small bathroom is close to the front door, and I didn\'t want guests to &#34;catch a whiff&#34; of it when they walked in the door.The only thing that I have to say that could be interpreted as negative would be that the metal piece that pushes the lid up (when you step on the pedal) gets covered by the plastic bag. Then, when the lid snaps onto the pail, it holds the bag in place, so that piece of plastic covering the metal gets pushed up every time you step on the pedal. If there is no slack for the bag, it could tear at that spot. To prevent that from happening (in addition to using an 8-gallon bag), I make sure that there is only about one inch of the bag hanging on the outside of the pail when I snap the lid in place, meaning that there is plenty of slack inside so the bag doesn\'t tear in the spot where the metal piece pushes up. I do not find this to be enough reason to deduct a star, so I am still giving it five stars.I am happy with this purchase, and I believe that despite emptying it out more often than other people may find necessary, it is still more environmentally friendly than using at least two grocery store bags every day, and it is cheaper than buying proprietary refills for pails that are made specifically for kitty litter.",5

It is a very easy stroller to use.  The kids enjoy being in it.  It seems rather comfortable for them.  My 2 1/2year old climbs in it without being asked or putting up a fight.  My only complaint is the front wheel.  It is not a swivel wheel, therefore, it is VERY annoying to try and turn the stroller.  You have to push down on the bar to get the front wheel off the ground.  That is fine if it is once in a while, but it gets a little hard when you need to turn many different times.",3

"1502","Child Airplane Travel Harness - Cares Safety Restraint System - The Only FAA Approved Child Flying Safety Device","The belt that wraps around the seat must secure under the tray table on the back of the seat. This limits the vertical position options. On Virgin America we could not adjust the belt to be high enough, so the shoulder straps pulled at my son\'s shoulders, making him quite uncomfortable.  Also, there is no crotch belt, so though the child is secured from flying up in turbulence,  he could wiggle out from the bottom.The reality is I wish we had used an FAA approved car seat. Our child slid out from the bottom and cried because the shoulder straps were too low.  We could not use it for the whole flight.I gave three stars because during take - off and landing these as traps work fine and really do secure the child. They are impractical for a whole flight.",3

The handles come at a comfortable height already and then extend out for those of us over 6\' tall.  My daughter is comfortable in it and it saves my back every time.  Handling is smooth and it is still comforable when my 5\'4 mother pushes it.  It is adorable in pink.  It does not have much storage space, but it is an umbrella stroller so it is comparable to others.  It does have lots of zippers and spaces to hold small items but if you are as tall as me, all of this is extra when you consider the height of the stroller. This was such a great idea and I can\'t imagine why more companies don\'t add this extension to the handles.",5

"1517","The First Year\'s Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I love this tub! I have to admit that this is the only tub I have used, but it has fullfilled everything I have needed it to. It is great because it has two sides, one for an infant which has a reclined back. and once the baby is old enough, there is a toddler side with a straight back. At first, I used it on my bathroom countertop. That worked very well. Once the baby started splashing (around 5 months) I place the tub in the bathroom tub and that works very well. It design allows the baby to sit up on his own, so I don\'t have to sit there holding him up. I can just sit next to the tub and watch him play and splash. I feel this is a very safe and efficient way of bathing my baby and I will be sad when he outgrows it (he is 7 months now and about 22 pounds and 28 inches). I highly recommend this tub.

The only negative comment I have to say about it is that the stroller canopies are very cheaply made.  But the rest of the stroller is so good that it outweighs the bad.

This one is easy to clean, has a double tray that I can remove with one hand, and very secure straps if your child tries to climb like mine.  The only issue I have is that I can\'t unfold it with one hand, I need to use both.  Not a big deal for me because I never fold it up! I like that the cover is gender neutral as well in case my next is a boy plus it blends decent with the house. But its a high chair...how well can I hide it? About as much as all the other baby stuff in my house. Bottom line, decent highchair for your dollar.",NA

You have to walk to the side of the stroller, pushing with one hand.  Do not get this if you have a Frog.

At 20 months, these are a great size for her, and they are a good quality ... they don\'t seem like they\'ll fall apart or have plastic that will break when she throws them onto the floor.  She likes the dots, which she refers to as &#34;buttons&#34;.",5
"1534","Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We bought two of these for our infant twins, based off of all the positive reviews.  We love them.  They\'re perfect.  Can be easily thrown into the sink or dishwasher.  Even the straps can come out easily to be washed.  They\'re light and we\'d be able to cart them around easily if needed.  I don\'t understand why someone would buy a more cumbersome, expensive highchair?!?",5
"1535","NUK Gerber Fun Grips Cup, 7 Ounce, 2 Pack (4 Count), Colors May Vary","My order came with 4 cups, as advertised. Nuk is the ONLY cup I have found, and I have tried about 10 different brands, that is truly leak proof. The valve is 1 piece so it can\'t come apart in the cup while in use. Many of my other cups will do that. My kids throw these cups all the time and the lid and valve stays secure.",5

"1537","Toddler Bed Sheet Set 100% Cotton, 3 Piece Set Color: Sage Green","These sheets were exactly as advertised.  I was looking for a set of sheets that are soft and would fit the crib mattress in our toddler bed.  The sheets fit great - including the top sheet that has a fitted bottom and the pillow case fit the NoJo toddler pillow just right.  I purchased Sage Green to match the safari baby quilt and accessories we already had.  The only downfall is that they are not totally wrinkle-free but I would say that they are the same as the 500 thread count sheets on my bed (some crinkling at the top).  I\'ll trade that for the softness every time.  The softness of the sheets helped my son to transition to the new bed.",5
"1538","Safety 1st Expandable Table Edge Bumper","we put this on our coffee table, which is 140&#34;.  i had to tug and pull quite a bit to get it on there and expecially to get the corner pads in.  but now it gapes a little on the sides.  that said, it\'s a good solution that doesn\'t involve putting adhesive on nice furniture. At 32 bucks, it does seem like an expensive fix.",4
"1539","Maclaren Techno Stroller XLR Stroller, Black/Champagne","Before purchasing this stroller (or &#34;buggy&#34; as out British cousins call it), we went to a physical store and tested close to 20 different strollers. One thing we realized early is that we did not want a jogger: we did not like the decreased stability of a 3-wheel system, and, frankly, we had no intention of going for a jog with our baby. Another deal-breaker for us was the inability of most &#34;super-modern&#34; systems to have our infant fully reclined: there was either a 30-degree recline maximum, or a strange combination whereas baby\'s back was flat, but his legs were still up in the air. So, in the end, this Maclaren system was the only viable combination for us, as it allows for virtually flat recline, provides great stability, has 4 traditional wheels with decent shock absorbers, and boasts a huge full-coverage hood. In addition, it is rather easy to fold and unfold, and does not weigh that much. But here is my most important advice to new parents: go to a physical store to try out different strollers, and take your baby with you. When you find something that you like, put you baby into that stroller and observe. I trust that your baby will let you know how he/she feels about the new ride. Out son loved being in this stroller from the first moment, and this fact sealed our decision.",NA

Glad that we found them and the prompt delivery kept potential baby-drama at bay.",NA
"1541","Fisher-Price Meal on the Go","For solid foods this container is okay.  I would avoid this item if you want something leak proof.  The lids are difficult to snap down, and even with a lot of effort to make sure that the lids were sealed all the way around, liquid still escaped from both sides.  I would only use this for foods like mac/cheese, cheerios, and items of similar consistency... Cleans really easily in the dishwasher, though.",2
"1542","Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","The design of this toy arch is incredible, it attaches to pretty much anything and the arch itself is hinged so you can adjust any part of it to be closer or farther away from the baby. I have used it on a bouncy seat, two different car seats and my stroller. It is easy to put on and remove from anything. The toys make my little guy very happy. A few of them do come off (they have velcro), which we just recently discovered, so I have to make sure he doesn\'t toss them out of the stroller, but they are quite safe for chewing on once removed.",5

"1547","Graco FastAction Fold Sport Stroller Click Connect Stroller, Gotham","Overall, this is a wonderful stroller.  This stroller was relative easy to assemble - that\'s a complement coming from someone who dislikes assembling things.  Compared to other sport strollers, the footprint on the Graco FastAction is pretty similar both open and folded.  As for the quick folding, I was somewhat skeptical at first, but surprisingly the FastAction (one-second) fold actually works pretty well.",4

"1551","Baby Einstein Around The World Discovery Center","We have a small house so I had resisted getting an exersaucer when our little guy was big enough for one.  But after seeing how much fun he had in the ones at school, I wanted to give him the option for playing in one on the weekends.  I was concerned that we\'d only use it for a couple of months as he was already 28 inches, but said what the heck.  Got it, easy to put together, and was delighted to find that on the low setting he is almost flat footed, but at the middle setting he is barely on his tiptoes.  I have no worries that he will be able to use this until he grows out of it or is walking.  It\'s a very busy center, but he is old enough that it\'s not overwhelming.  Without the stabilizers he can get some nice rocking and rolling but it is nowhere near tipping it over.We have only had it a few days so can\'t say how well the toys wear but if there are any concerns will be sure to come back and report!",5
"1552","Leachco Easy Teether XL Side Crib Rail Cover, 2 Pack, Ivory","I had to break down and buy these for our crib. We spent a lot of money on a nice crib, and started seeing chip marks on it. Took me a bit to figure out how they got there, until I walked in on my son with his teeth dug into the wood. These ""covers"" aren\'t exactly beautiful, but he was ruining the crib. So it\'s protecting the wood from further damage, and more importantly keeping the chips out of his mouth. I had bought the one for the front of the crib, not thinking he would move to the sides, but I was mistaken. I have a convertable crib. They are a bit big for the sides, but they work perfectly. And actually fit just fine.",5

Of course, that would be an issue with any splat mat that can be easily folded, so overall this is great.",4

"1561","Keekaroo Height Right High Chair, Infant Insert and Tray Combo, Natural/Cherry","I bought my first of these chairs when my now 2 1/2 year old was 6 months old. He is still using it and I imagine will be for some time to come.I have another baby now who is 6 months old and in need of a highchair of his own. I considered giving him his older brothers and moving my older boy into something else. But after some consideration the older boy does so darn well in this chair still that I didn\'t want to take it away from him.So I\'m purchasing my second as we speak. Bought the first here on amazon but just bought the second from ""The Furniture Store"" as they currently have the best price on the internet.A few things that you might find helpful....When I purchased the first I also got the infant seat.... A must. But when I got the infant seat and installed it I felt like I still needed something more behind his back instead of just the hard wooden back. So I also purchased the toddler flat seat and back cushion combo. I took the back cushion and used it in combination with the infant seat and it was beyond perfect! In fact that is how the chair remained configured until my boy was a little over two. He took the back cushion off when he was about two as he found it more comfortable without it now that he was bigger.Just yesterday (he is now 2 years 7 months old) I removed the infant seat and installed the flat cushion toddler seat. So he is now sitting in the chair with just the flat cushion seat and no back cushion. He was very pleased with the new configuration. I\'m ok not having the back cushion on his chair as he climbs up into the chair himself and if he grabs the back cushion while climbing up the cushion will pull out of the chair and he will fly cushion in hand the the floor.I must admit I partially delayed the use of the flat toddler seat because I didn\'t realize that you could still use the seat belt with it and I still like to have him buckled in. But to my surprise you can still use the seatbelt with the toddler flat seat!So now I will take the back cushion and infant seat from the first chair and will install them on the new one coming for my 6 month old.This chair has been great! It\'s easy to clean, very sturdy, looks like a nice piece of furniture and not another plastic hunk of kid crap like we all probably have a ton of.  I use little plastic kid plates on it so the tray size that others have complained about is not a problem as I wouldn\'t want a bigger plate anyway. If you can get your kid to eat enough food to fill a big plate that\'s great but I\'m lucky if mine will eat off a 5inch one at all.  So yes you must use two hands to get the tray off but I don\'t find that to be an issue. I\'d say this is a pretty darn close to perfect chair.If I have a third kiddo I most likely will have a third Keekaroo!Update....Don\'t try to order from the furniture store.  I just purchased my second chair from Amazon after all as my order with ""The Furniture Store"" fell through. I guess the cost was too good to be true from them. Even though there were some stores selling at maby a $10 discount from amazons price I trust amazon and they always do right by me so they got my order in the end.",5
"1562","Kushies On The Go Snack Bag, Blue Square, Small","I was unsure what size I wanted to get because this was my first replacement towards disposable plastic zip-lock bags (yay!). I went with the largest size they had because the bigger the better, right? There was no harm in getting a size too big, but too small would have a problem fitting my sandwiches.When I got it, it was the right size for me. I\'m a high school student who brings a simple lunch to school: a regular sized sandwich, a capri sun, and perhaps a bag of chips or dried fruit. Those three things all fit snugly into the Kushies and I was so satisfied.If you\'re contemplating your choice based on the reviews that say it barely holds anything, just get the largest size possible. It won\'t hurt you. After all, a little extra room doesn\'t hurt.By the way, the color is gorgeous and the material shows potential to endure the next four years of college. Definitely machine-washable and I recommend, if putting a sandwich in, you should saran wrap it first. That\'s what I do to keep it clean!",5
"1563","Smart Bottoms Smart 3.1 OS Organic All-in-one Cloth Diaper (Bloom)","These took a little longer to prep than our other cotton diapers but they are absolutely fabulous! We use AIO\'s during the day, mostly Simplexes. When I decided to get rid of our microfiber Freetimes, I was on the hunt for another cotton AIO to replace them and I\'m so glad I found these. The PUL outer is nice and thick. The organic cotton inner is very soft and super absorbent. These don\'t take long to dry. About as long as our simplexes and night time fitteds... much quicker than grovia AIO\'s and original elementals. The elastic is thick and stretchy and has already outlasted our BumGenius elastic. I highly recommend these diapers!",NA
"1564","Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard","We purchased this to give our Doberman puppy a place to play during house training.  We placed a whelping pad on the floor to protect the carpet.  This play yard is big enough for all of her toys, blankets, and food bowls.  We\'ve even let the adult Doberman go inside and play with her, and there\'s still plenty of room for them to roll around on the floor together.  I don\'t have it completely closed but instead have it opened and backed up to a wall.  I did not attach it to a while, and while the adult is able to inadvertently scoot it across the floor while playing, the puppy is not.  It is very sturdy and EXTREMELY easy to move from one room to another.  I would definitely purchase this item again and would recommend it to anyone!",5

Now I can attend to my older daughter and have my hands free now to do other things, like cook, e-mail, and write this review.This item has 6 speeds of swing, and four different swing positions.

"1569","green sprouts Aqua Bottle, Pink, 10 Ounce","I have many cups like this one - because it has been virtually spill proof, closes for on the go, and is friendly for toddlers who like to explore every aspect of the cup. Doesn\'t leak most of the time... If the cup has been out of the fridge and there\'s a big temperature change the pressure from that temperature difference can cause some leakage out of the straw. Also my daughter when teething occasionally likes to bite through the top part of the straw attachment (they give you replacements!). All in all great cup no real spill problems, my 2 year old daughter can\'t take the top off the cup, can\'t push in the top (as in some brands), and there\'s no extra valve for the liquid (or pressure) to come out - meaning no little fingers creating big holes in the cup.",4

I bought a G**** booster seat before I purchased this one! but I returned it because it seemed very uncomfortable and there was not enough cushion for my son! also there was no back support.

"1575","Bumbo Seat Play Tray, Ivory","This tray is very useful and I am glad I made the purchase. When I attach it to my Bumbo, it stays put. However, putting it on with a squirming baby can be tricky. You have to be sure not to pinch those chubby baby legs, and you have to lift the seat up off the ground a few degrees to get it on. This would worry me if my baby was big enough to slip out, but luckily she isn\'t. The tray itself is not very wide, so it won\'t fit a standard suction plate, like the Sugarbooger brand. At it\'s widest from baby\'s chest out, it is 6 1/4 inches within the raised edges. I wish I would have known this before I purchased a plate, but otherwise, I am happy with the tray.",4

We have put her books in the basket (which adds some weight to it) and she is already pushing the cart around and pulling up and sitting down by holding onto the walker.

The price for two is almost the same as the price for one in CVS or the grocery store. I bought these cups for my kiddo when he was 7 months old and they have held up well over a year later. They are easy to clean and dishwasher safe (top rack only). The arrows show you exactly where to lineup the lid/cup to ensure a super tight spill proof lock. The handles have that rubber grippy feel which helps my kiddo hold on to the cup easily! I have found that even if my kid tips this cup upside down only a few drops will escape from the mouthpiece. I think this is a great value for my money! Highly recommend!",5

I\'m rather skinny and even I don\'t like how small the boppy is. I bought one of these pillows of my own and I\'ve used it on my son since he was 3 pounds to nurse, rock to sleep, and to help with tummy time. He\'s 18 pounds now and it still comforts him to sleep.

Time to purchase a 2010 Toyota Corolla, everyone tells me they last forever. That remains to be seen. A purchase like this gives me pause to consider how best to care for my family while caring for my car. I know that these two wonderful children are prone to play in sandboxes, walk through mud puddles, and track all sorts of outdoor unholiness into the back seat of my car. Those two wonderful kids with their two wonderful, growing legs (four combined) can\'t help but press the soles of their shoes hard into the back of my seat and the seat of my beautiful driving companion. If only there were away to allow those to wonderful kids to be their two wonderful precocious selves and protect the back of my like new seats, if only. And oh, if only it could be found at a reasonable price. I thought this as I drove about town, calmly asking my children to keep their feet off the back of my seat. And then, Britax. Perfectly fit, slim profile, well made, Britax. It is as if these kick mats were designed with the 2010 Toyota Corolla in mind. How did you know Britax, how did you know? Now my brood and I ride around town all day looking at flags and clouds, watching birds build nests, and old folks watching the traffic go by, with nary a word of correction as my two wonderful children kick the back of my seat  and the seat of my lover to their hearts content.",5
"1594","Custom Cradle/Bassinet Mattress - size: 17x31x2","One reviewer stated this mattress is a ""Perfect Fit"" for her Arm\'s Reach Co-Sleeper Brand Mini bassinet. IT IS NOT. In the comments under her review another customer asked if she was able to get this mattress in the correct measurements, which are not 17 x 31 but rather 18.75 x 31.5. She replied to that customer that she just doubled up on sheets to compensate for the gap this mattress leaves in the Arm\'s Reach/Co-Sleeper Brand Mini bassinet. This trick does not work -- I tried it -- and even if ten sheets made it fit snugger, it\'s not a safe fix. This is just the wrong size mattress and jerry rigging it to work isn\'t responsible -- the mattress is a suffocation hazard in these bassinets.I bought this for my Arm\'s Reach Co-Sleeper Brand Clear-Vue Bassinet. The measurements between the Mini and the Clear-Vue are IDENTICAL. Even the Arm\'s Reach/Co-Sleeper brand website says about the Clear-Vue bassinet: ""Same size as the CO-SLEEPER brand Mini, this product takes the same accessories!"" The listing for the Co-Sleeper Mini here on Amazon, as well as the tag on the mattress included with my Clear-Vue bassinet, both say the measurements are 17.5 x 31.1 x 0.8. THIS IS NOT TRUE. On the manufacturer\'s own website they state clearly that the organic replacement mattress size is actually 18.75"" x 31.75"" x 1.5"" and this goes for the Mini as well. This information is provided when you click on ""Accessories"" and attempt to buy a replacement mattress pad for these bassinets. Only THEN do they tell you what the ACTUAL measurements are for these mattresses. The mattress I am reviewing here on Amazon now is FAR too small to fit these bassinets. When I put it in today I was shocked. There is a HUGE gap all the way around the mattress that is nothing short of a death trap for an infant. The mattress should be so tight/flush with the walls of the bassinet that there is no way for the baby\'s face or head to slip into a gap and suffocate. This mattress should be 18.75 x 31.75 and not 17 x 31 like this one.Plain and simple -- this mattress is TOO SMALL for the Arm\'s Reach Co-Sleeper Mini bassinet, the Mini Convertible bassinet or even the Clear-Vue bassinet. There is an organic mattress offered by the manufacturer for $80 but it\'s not as thick as this mattress I\'m reviewing now. What I have to say about the quality of this mattress: it\'s thick and soft (maybe even lacking firmness to a concerning degree?) but it does not fit my bassinet by any stretch of the imagination so it must go back. I hope this review helps future owners of these Arm\'s Reach Co-Sleeper Brand bassinets so that they don\'t waste their time and money on return shipping costs like I\'m about to do.",3
"1595","Chicco Keyfit 22 Pound Infant Car Seat And Base, Hazelwood","After a LOT of research I decided on the KeyFit 22 for my second child. The Britax B-safe was the runner up but is heavier and a little pricier. For our first child we had had the Graco Snugride but that was purchased in 2005 and had long since been passed on. The KeyFit is a sturdy, well made seat and gets my vote for ease of use and a great price tag! It is very easy to install properly with the easy-to-see leveling bubble and the built in adjustor with a lot of different height options to level it off. I remember taking my first car seat to the fire station to check that it was installed properly only to have them stuff a swimming pool \'noodle\' (cut in 2ft lengths) under the seat to get it level. This is soooo much easier!Quick Pros:1. very easy to install at the proper angle2. can be used with or without the base3. machine washable cover. I have taken it off just to see how easy it was, it only took a few minutes, but haven\'t actually washed it yet so I can\'t attest to how the fabric will hold up but it seems as though it would hold up quite well.4. handle can be used to hold car seat stable (keep it from rocking) while seat is on a table or the floor5. LATCH buckles store neatly within the seat and are easy to attach and tighten6. harness is easy to click and undo (unlike some carriers I looked at with a \'puzzle lock)7. it is one of the most light weight seats out there8. sturdy seat with sturdy base too. FYI the base is interchangeable with the KeyFit 309. on a vain note, the colors look great with my tan leather interiorCons:1. The sun shade is not very large2. the carrying handle is comfortable, but not as comfortable as someNow that I have been using the seat for a few months I would like to add one thing to the cons list:3. This seat does not have grooves  underneath where my old Graco did. The Graco\'s grooves allowed it to fit into the seat area of a shopping cart. Now instead, I have to either put the entire car seat in the big basket section of the cart which takes up almost the entire cart, or move the (sometimes sleeping) baby into the Baby Bjorn if I want to do a larger shopping trip....not the end of the world but certainly not convenient. I suppose a buyer should consider this more seriously if you will be having to do the infant seat-to-Baby Bijorn switch in the parking lot in the cold weather.....maybe I\'ll just start doing home delivery for my groceries over the winter.Other than that, I am still very happy with the infant seat.P.S. It fits into either the Chicco Caddy or the Baby Trend Snap n\' Go",NA

My husband and I both began dreading it so much that we were sometimes guilty of putting off a little longer than we should. Now we don\'t mind it at all. The first time we used it she started to cry as usual, but then she gave right in and relaxed. She became a smiling, happy baby during diaper changes! My only suggestion to the designer of this product would be add a few snaps in addition to or instead of the velcro, for when babes start learning how to undo it. My baby has learned how to open the velcro closure and wriggle her arms free, although most of the time she will still just lay there on top of it and cooperate. I will probably just add snaps myself.",5

The Magic Bumper did the trick. He never rolls off anymore and he sleeps through the night perfectly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is I wish the bumper was a little longer...it seems to fall a little too short for my taste.

All the carseats I\'ve had, the harness straps are designed in such a way that they are hard to buckle and there is never enough slack so my kids feel tight and uncomfortable.

"1638","Chicco Lullaby Magic Play Yard - Rattania","We just bought this exact play yard yesterday (23 May 2013) from the local Babies R Us for $199.99 (it was not on sale). I really like the colors, it\'s sturdy, and it does what it\'s supposed to.I preferred this one over the SE and LX versions of Chicco\'s play yards because the changing table completely removes from the frame, and because the mobile swings off to the side. In the reviews for the SE and LX versions I read that the mobile can be a hassle because it stretches over the whole play yard, although that mobile does double as a floor gym and this one does not. The price differences at Babies R Us were SE-179.99, XL-189.99, and Magic-199.99.The padding for this version of Chicco\'s play yard is a tiny bit more soft than the SE and LX versions. It is almost a negligible difference, though.I like that the side pockets are open by the plastic frame. I\'m sure I would have a harder time grabbing things out of the flat mesh ones in the SE or LX versions one handed.We\'re using it as a bassinet in the master bedroom for now, and we don\'t really anticipate packing it up and taking it anywhere. It took about 20 minutes to assemble, and I\'m sure that time would be cut by more than half the next time we need to assemble it.Now I just need my baby to be born so he can try it out!

I bought this product after careful research about all the different bottle and nipple types available because I was worried about nipple confusion. We have two main complaints about these bottles.1. My newborn had trouble getting the milk out (we even tried to suck on it and it was really difficult!) and because he had to work so hard to get the milk out he ended up sucking in a lot of air around the nipple.2. Milk gets stuck between the two nipples and the baby can\'t get it all out which resulted in a loss of about a ounce of beast milk loss (and when you pump milk that is a lot of milk to go to waste!)In a pinch one day we bought a Playtex VentAire Advanced bottle (BPA free) and what a difference it made! The baby could easily get the milk out without sucking in air around the nipple. Also the design makes it much easier to hand wash the bottles.

"1650","JL Childress Wheelie Car Seat Travel Bag, Black","Having taken two previous flights and damaging our car seat by awkwardly carrying it by the straps, I ordered this bag for our most recent flight and I am so glad I did.  After reading the other reviews about how the bottom fell off, I was worried, but our bag came with the bottom securely attached leaving me to believe that the company either fixed the problem or they have quality control issues.  If the bottom does fall off of yours or the zipper breaks, do not throw it away.  Take it to a luggage/shoe repair shop and for a reasonable price, the bag can be fixed.I have an Evenflo Triump car seat and man was I nervous putting it in the bag the day of the flight.  It...just...barely...fit.  Like a glove.  My husband tried to pull it at the airport, but it just drug behind him.  He complained it wouldn\'t work because he was too tall (6\'3"").  Why does stress make us so stupid?  I adjusted the strap and then he could pull it just fine.  At first I couldn\'t understand why they didn\'t put four wheels on this so you wouldn\'t have to tilt it to pull it, but then the laws of physics dawned on me and I realized that this was truly the best design.I noticed several couples struggling with their unbagged car seats.  I felt so sorry for them.  This is so worth the money even for one trip.  It survived the trip on Allegiant Airlines back and forth.Update:  We have had this almost two years now and it has totally held up through about 8 round trip flights and is still as good as new.

"1655","Bright Starts Comfort and Harmony Portable Swing, Florabella","My daughter is turning one next week, and we have gotten a lot of use out of the swing. More so when she has been congested (to help keep her head elevated). Its very quiet and does not burn through batteries. We have been very happy with this swing its been easy to pack up and take to grandma\'s house if needed. And we did not want to own a big swing along with a travel swing, so this one has been perfect for us.",5

"1658","The First Years Star Teething Blanket","The Star Teething blanket arrived in a sealed bag that said \'ready to ship\'. It  is larger than I thought, more like a foot square, which is great because there is more my baby can grab.Washing instructions for \'before use\' according to paper tag: put in a pillowcase and throw in washer. Air dry. Although  I must say, even though I put it in two pillowcases the Star blanket was outside both when washer was done.Oddly enough, instructions on cloth tag attached to star say to ""Always hand wash""...Description of blanket:Terry cloth green body with a star in the center of one side of the body. The star is also terrycloth,  light blue, and  outlined in blue satiny piping. The star ""crinkles"" and the material listed is cellophane.The terry feels like microfiber. Each corner of the star is a different color.Each corner:Purple is satiny with an eyelet where you can loop through a flower shaped plastic ring that comes with package for this purpose. This ring has been detached several times by baby, so I must keep an eye or I will lose it. She likes to tug at it.Bright pink corner is ribbed, a close stripe corduroy.Blue corner feels like a rubbery material with a pattern of abstract people. My baby loves to chew on this.Orange corner has a squeezing ball of some sort inside. My baby has yet to discover this.Yellow corner is satiny with some embroidered \'suns\' in purple and pink. Purple center, pink rays.So far my baby really likes this and it\'s great because she tens to want to chew on her clothing.I would highly recommend it!",5
"1659","Especially for Baby Bottle Warmer","We have been using this warmer & Dr. Browns 8oz. bottles with no problem.  Unit works great.  The only problem is that after only 2 months of use, the warmer is very rusty and smells like rust when heating.  It doesn\'t bother the baby, but I\'d rather not have to clean the unit of rust.  It would make an otherwise excellent product to be outstanding if they would make the heater stainless steel so it wouldn\'t rust!",4

They are doing the job, he is not able to chew on the crib anymore, but they are very easily removed.  We had to use all 4 (one package) end to end to cover one side of the crib rail.  I\'m hoping he stops chewing soon, or we will have to get something else, because he will soon have it figured out how to pull them off.",3

"1664","green sprouts 8 Ounce Trainer Bottle, Blue","I was trying to get my infant off the bottle and onto a sippy cup, and I literally tried everything. I had enough inventory for a sippy cup store, and I still couldn\'t find anything my daughter liked. After a recommendation from a friend, I decided to buy this one from Whole Foods. SHE LOVED IT. In fact, it\'s been close to a year, and she won\'t drink out of anything else. One night, we left this cup at our nanny\'s place, and my daughter wouldn\'t drink ANYTHING. That\'s when I realized I should buy a backup cup for those emergencies. I ended up buying the green one from Amazon. The only reason I\'m giving this one less star is because this top tends to suck up more air and gets \'stuck\', where we have to open up the lid to release the air. The first one we bought doesn\'t have that issue, so I\'m guessing it\'s just a manufacturing flub. My daughter loves this cup so much, it ended up in her professional pictures - she wouldn\'t let go it for a proper shot!",4

"1666","Jeep Overland Limited Jogging Stroller with Front Fixed Wheel, Fierce","Hi there i\'ve had this stroller for a little over a month now, I take my 1 year old out in it;  The pro\'s of course is the ablity to play the i-pod on the speaker (batteries not included).  The little storage pouch on the chair is good for sticking my keys and underneath has room for extra gear;  the cup holders are good for a .5 liter of water (there are two of them).  The adjustable handlebars are a nice funtion too.  I\'ve used the pedometer, but i just prefer to wear my GPS.Con\'s:When it\'s time to turn...get ready you have to really use your CORE to do this.  I do it by pulling back to the get the fron wheel up and then turn.  It\'s not that bad, and helps the whole workout but folks should be prepared.Overall I don\'t have any real gripes with the stroller.",4

So I ordered this one but will most likely return it if I can\'t find a better replacement.  The details:The Good: easy to set up, very lite weight, nice colors, rolls nicely, great height adjusting handle barThe Bad:-crotch strap positioned too far back, constant pressure in that area.  won\'t be comfortable when not in diapers.-tray is positioned too far forward so easy to remove child (don\'t have to worry about scraping her thighs) but she will never reach it till she\'s 6!- leg flap adjustment doesn\'t want to stay in lowest position- seat side protection gets folded into stroller upon collapse and stays bent when unfolded-didn\'t like the draw strap recline system- canopy rather small for coverage- storage pocket completely hidden when seat is upright.- storage basket is smallish although very easy to access.The (deal breaker) Ugly:- there is no peep window in top of canopy. cannot see my daughter. NOT OK. (there is a peep window for fully reclined position but you\'d have to stand on your head or knees to see thru it.)- canopy does not stay back far enough when folded.  cannot see my daughter. NOT OK.So I guess my main issue is the canopy.I know...I want a cadillac that weighs the same as a fiesta!",3

And once it arrives you\'ll see why I\'m saying that.Pray I\'ve not had an accident to prove it\'s safety feature and I hope I don\'t but it give you, the parent, the peace of mind.It\'s a breeze to install, if your car has the Latch system, and my 3 day year old newborn was sitting in it comfortably (she did not cry, in fact she fell asleep right before we left the hospital). FYI my baby girl was weighin 7 lbs 15 Oz and measured 21.5 inches.It fits my 2003 Mitsubishi Montero and 2013 Subaru Impreza WRX STI without any probelm.If need be, the owner\'s manual states that they would ship a cushion if the baby is too small, free of charge. So take note of that.Recaro, makes performance car seats, and they are one of the best out there. And me being a auto enthusiast I had to get this :).Overall, I\'m very satisfied with the product. Would recommend it to friends without hesitance.",5

I gave it two stars because it does work and I don\'t notice much static, but just over a month after purchasing it the voice activation feature has stopped working.

Sometimes I can hear our daughter before the sensor picks it up but only when I\'m already paying attention, like after the sensor went off but she quieted down immediately.The temperature sensor is the real value-add win, especially if you live in an area of the world that doesn\'t have central air as a standard feature for most apartments.4 stars because it doesn\'t wow me beyond its reliability and dedication to its primary function.  I feel I got my money\'s worth on this item.",4

"1682","The First Year\'s Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I agree with the reviewer who said this tub is a perfect shower gift. I received it as a gift and my friends who threw the shower used it as a punch bowl to serve punch from at the shower. I know it sounds weird, but it was adorable - even had a rubber ducky floating in it!But that\'s not why I love this tub. I love it because my 5 week old daughter loves it! She can be totally fussy, but when I put her in the tub right before bed, she calms right down. I know a lot of it has to do with being submerged in warm water, but I think the sling helps a lot too by cradling her and making her feel safe. I love the clean water area on the end, but I wish it were a little bigger. I use a plastic cup to get the clean water out to pour on her, but it\'s a little tight.Overall though I love this tub! I have recommended it to many friends.",5
"1683","Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!","I absolutely LOVE these blankets.  So much so, that we give them out to all new parents.  I LOVE that they can be used all year round and for multiple purposes.  The size is great because most receiving blankets can\'t even swaddle a baby because they\'re too small and are just a joke.  These have more than enough room to swaddle a baby.  They\'re also great for covering the carseat in the spring/summer months to keep the sun out of baby\'s eyes without getting the baby too hot or restricting airflow.  I\'ve also used mine as a nursing cover when I couldn\'t find mine AND because of it\'s big size, it came in handy as a giant burp cloth on several occasions (just fold it a couple of times and it becomes the perfect size and is surprisingly absorbant!)  I would definitely recommend this product to any new parent out there.  It\'s the perfect blanket and can fold down to a nice, compact size.  LOVE it!",5

"1690","Trend Lab CribWrap Fleece Rail Cover for Long Rail, Blue, Wide","We purchased this because our son was starting to chew on the $2000 convertible crib we purchased.  Since this was going to be a convertible crib that is going to be a future bed, which will be future guest room furniture when the kids moves on in life i figured i would rather save myself from the conversation i would have with future guest about way i allowed my kid to chew up his furniture like a dog.This item is very well made, nicely packaged and very easy to install.  As you see in the photo it easily ties onto the crib on the from.  It\'s waterproof to stop all of the drool so my $2000 crib is totally protected.Bottom line is if you spent a bunch of your hard earned money on a nice crib hoping that you will never have to purchase furniture for a room again and you now have a baby that has turned teething dog this is a good item to get.  We opted out of the side rail guards so they won\'t be staying once it converts to a bed.",5

I picked it up at my grocery store and was nervous at the price for a brush, but as soon as I used it, realized not all brushes are the same. This brush works great and the detachable piece at the bottom is great for cleaning sippy cup valves and hard to reach places, as well as cleaning the brush itself! Highly recommend if you buy the OXO sippy cups as well.",5

That annoying beeping kept going off indicating the receivers could not find the monitor.  Even if I did angle the receivers just right and they did find the monitor, they clicked every couple of seconds.  I didn\'t bother trying to sleep with them because it would not have worked.

This is the same product without the Baby Jogger brand name and costs almost $15 less!  I gave only 4 stars because the head support is kind of thick and pushed my baby\'s head forward, so I removed it.

"1699","MobiCam DXR Touch Baby Monitor","I purchased this camera because I have a 4 year old and I\'m expecting a second child, therefore the idea of having 2 cameras and only one monitor sounded very appealing. However, my issue with this product was the volume. It was very low to a point where I was worried I wasn\'t going to hear my daughter call, which actually happened. The image was good, sufficient to have a good idea of what was happening and it was very easy to set up. But for me, the volume, was the reason for the 2 stars, I don\'t like the idea of not having a higher volume set up. I was able to ship the camera back through Amazon without a problem and received the refund in a timely manner. Before returning the product I sent 2 e-mails to the manufacturer asking about the set up of the volume but didn\'t obtained a response. I ended up buying a simple audio monitor model of a different company.",2

I don\'t see an decrease in the baby\'s gasiness or fussiness but I do say these bottles DON\'T LEAK, and the nipple is narrower so the baby drools less when eating.  So we have ditched the AVENT and switched to the Dr. Browns, plus they are MADE IN THE USA.  The only flaw I see is that the once markings on the side are hard to read, we found one bottle where they were painted on and you could read them fine, the others are molded into the side of the bottle and are hard to read, especially at 3am feedings!!!!!!",4

"1717","MamaDoo Kids Foldable Play Yard Mattress Topper, Blue","The MamaDoo playard mattress fits my Graco Pack & Play (with the ridiculously hard cardboard) perfectly with no gaps or bubbles and will be an excellent toddler/travel mat when my youngest grows out of his playpen. I love that it folds, since we live in a tiny apartment and travel often. We can transport the mattress to grandma\'s house easily without it taking up the entire cargo area in my Mazda 5, or using half of our closet during storage. The foam is firm but comfortable, and I also bought the MamaDoo sheet in chocolate chip- it\'s a beautiful, rich brown in super soft cotton/spandex. I would absolutely recommend this product.",5

"1721","Manhattan Toy Soft Activity Book with Tethered Toy, Buzzing Through","I bought this in November to keep my then 9 month old daughter entertained while on an airplane.  She liked it ok and played with it a little, but it didn\'t hold her attention at all (still doesn\'t 2 months later).  It\'s a cute rhyming story and I like that each page has moving pieces to play with or suck on, but it\'s nothing special and doesn\'t warrant the enormous price tag just for a cloth book.  It costs twice as much as other books and is NOT twice as good.  I would give 4 stars if it were under ten dollars.",3
"1722","3 Pack Snack Trap (colors may vary)","What did our parents do besides clean up our messes? I mean really. I spent so much time cleaning up my Zachy\'s Cheerios and snackies before I got this cup. Just the other week, my mom spilled all of his snackies on the floor when opening one of his snack containers! I went the next day, Monday and bought one of these Snack Trap cups. Granted, it costs a good bit more than those little cups at a local Dollar Tree, but hey, isn\'t it worth it not to have to clean up after your little one AND the grandparents? ;-) Anyway, spend the extra dollars and get one!!! It is well worth the money. My little man got the hang of it after one showing.  He loves to shake it and listen to the snackies inside, then he just reaches in that cute little hand and grabs a snack and just grins. He can take it all over the house and I don\'t have to go behind him with the vacuum. Now keep in mind, those Cheerios are small and sometimes they do come out, but only one to two at a time. Can\'t be 100% perfect, right? I highly recommend this cup for any mom or grandmom that is on the go or even just relaxing at home. 5 stars!",NA

No tools were required for the simple assembly and the sides can be adjusted to fit must hallways or stairs.  I would recommend this product highly.",5

Great fit and finish (small details like magnet for the circulation flap and well-padded push bar are all there as you\'d expect for a premium stroller)3. Rides smooth with nice suspension.4. Fully reclines for sleep.Cons:1. At 3/4 the size of a full size stroller, this is simply not as light as the manufacturer is trying to claim.2. The one touch collapse button is not as smooth as other brands.3. Seat does not prop up as much as other brands; child would be more sprawled out. My toddler had no issues with this in terms of comfort (would not have hesitated to let me know if there was an issue!).",4
"1729","VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units","I bought these to replace an analog monitor that would get occasional loud buzzes due to interference. At the time, my wife and I were living in an apartment complex with a lot of wireless signals and these units performed great until they died almost a year after the purchase. This is the only reason for the 4 star rating. Thankfully, Amazon\'s customer service took care of the issue and sent us replacement units and we haven\'t had any issues since. We\'ve since moved into a home and the units still have a medium signal in the basement with the transmitter on the second floor in the opposite corner of the house. Having two parent units is also great as we can leave one permanently in our bedroom and the other can roam with us during the day for naps. I highly recommend this monitor to anyone with a lot of wireless interference.",4

This baby bouncer is so well engineered that it literally replicates the feel of a mother walking, or bouncing the baby on her hip, or many other such movements that the new born and young baby has felt either in utero or in the early months of life.  the smooth delivery of the motion is remarkable.  It truly is an engineering marvel that gives the baby an un interrupted sense of being with their mother as she moves.  The other aspect which is also wonderful is that you can by way of a USB connection play lullabies or music of choice for your baby.  It is integrated into the machine and allows for the use of your personal iPod, iPad, or other such musical device  with a USB connection.  I have given six of these as baby gifts and each recipient has told me that it was the very best gift that they had been given for their baby.  I think that says it all!",5

I wish there was a size between this and the newborn size, which she outgrew at 12 lbs.  They keep her cool while sleeping, hold up well to multiple washes, and the velcro is super strong.  The hole at the back is for harnesses, not poop checks!  You can lay this is a cradle, car seat, anything with a harness, put your kid in and harness them up, then swaddle.  Be careful to check that there is no hair on the fingers, toes, or in the swaddle if you wash it with your stuff.  Hair tourniquets (google it) are very common in swaddles due to the enclosed environment and repetitive movement of the hands or feet inside the swaddle.  We had one and it was not pleasant.  Compulsively check your kid\'s hands and feet for any loose hairs before swaddling.",5

As an interior designer I am incredibly picky when it comes to craftsmanship and design.  As a parent, sustainability is a priority when making purchases for my child.

As useful as the Graco has been for convenience with the car seat attachment, once she finally outgrew it, I knew I was definitely searching for a lightweight model this time. And I found what I was looking for!This is such a modern and comfortable stroller. It is so easy to manouvre and my daughter can even fall straight asleep in it before we leave the house for a walk.

The design of the mobile leaves much to be desired. The images are not easy to detect due to the poor design and the awkward way they fit together.

"1748","Quinny Zapp Xtra, Rocking Black","We got this stroller as somewhat of a gift from someone who\'d used it before. As a hand-me-down, I didn\'t expect much initially. I didn\'t bother push it around for a while, but eventually curiosity got the best of me. My first thought; this stroller is hands down, the easiest stroller to push around that I\'ve ever used. In fairness, I\'m comparing this to a clumsy car seat compatible stroller, a sit and stand stroller, and a slightly above average umbrella stroller... That\'s where I\'m building my viewpoints from. Compared to any of the strollers I\'ve pushed, this is much easier to control & push. I can maneuver my now 2 year old, who is nearly 30 lbs with ease, single-handed. If you hit a big, sharp turn, it might call for a second hand, but seldom do I need to. We\'ve got another little one also. 1I used to have to use 2 hands all the time to push her around, but not anymore. That means I can help with the second kid, hold a bag momentarily, etc. It\'s somewhat liberating to be honest.When we searched for strollers & decided to get an umbrella stroller, we tried some higher end strollers in the $100 range or so (not really high end, but higher end than a true umbrella stroller) & nothing steered this easily. That said, I think for the price, it\'s really pretty fair given the maneuverability of this stroller. Can you find something else that steers this well, but is cheaper? Don\'t know. I couldn\'t, but I don\'t have access to try them all. I know this one works. I know it\'s better than others we tried for not a whole lot less money, so in my book, it\'s a total winner.There are a couple of negative things to note, but just nothing I felt worthy of docking a star. First off - it\'s not the easiest thing to fold/unfold. It\'s not that bad though. I did it, under a minute, no instructions; first time I tried. It\'s pretty simple, but it\'s got a slight learning curve. Let\'s be honest though; most of these things do. Once it\'s folded, it\'s nice and compact, and most importantly, it\'s small. Second, no cup holder... That\'s almost worth a star, but it\'s just not that big of a deal to me. I think a cup holder would honestly get in the way of how this thing folds.Overall though, I think this stroller brings a lot of value. Okay, it\'s not a $900 stroller. It\'s also not a $60 umbrella stroller. It pushes and controls nicely & easily. It folds down small & takes up very little space. It works just fine for me!",5

"1751","NoJo Secure-Me Soild Mesh Crib Liner, Ivory","It comes in four different pieces and the panels don\'t seem to line up right with the dimensions of the crib so when it is tied it is either too loose or it is pulling away from the side.  However the color is good and it will do the job.",4
"1752","Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Bought the booster seat for a 5 month old who sits with assistance/support. I had three main considerations:1) I did not want to invest in buying a fancy high chair that has an option for infants to use it for just a couple of months but was concerned the baby will not be comfortable in this one.2) I looked for a chair that occupies minimal space by either folding or fitting under the dinning table3) I wanted something that is easy to keep clean.This booster is great in all of these three aspects and at times even exceeded my expectations:1) The baby is stable. We did put a folded blanket at the side of the chair to make the fit better. And I love the fact that this chair will continue to be used up until she sits at the table on a regular chair. Great investment! She likes the chair and gets tiered of sitting only near the end of the feeding session.2) The use of the two straps (one around the seat and one around the back of the chair) make it stable on the chair. It is low enough to be able to move the chair with the booster under the dinning table. So it takes minimal space and allows the baby to sit at the dinner table with the family, which makes feeding so much more fun.3) Cleaning-wise it is just wonderful -- easy to wipe off plastic that can be taken apart and thrown into the dishwasher.The only downside: You cannot put the baby in when the table compartment is attached to the chair. So you have to remove it and put it back in once the baby sits there. Its is not hard to do, but it is an annoying extra step to take, sometimes with a hungry or a fussy baby. Plus, I thought the whole point of a removable try is that you dont have to take off the whole table compartment for cleaning -- only the insert. But in reality you need to take them both anyways, so what\'s the point?!",4

"1756","North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","We have had a problem with 2 of our dogs starting to ""soil"" the carpet in one room in particular.  All we needed to do is keep them out, but keeping the door closed all the time was simply impractical.  This gate was so reasonably priced and so well reviewed that we had to give it a try. Wow, glad we did!  This is a terrific product!  I just wish we had had this when the kids were small!I don\'t think the product discription is clear enough.  This is a spring loaded gate, that if you open it all the way (it swings in or out), it will stay open.  But if you only open it part way, it swings closed again when you let go.  Opening is simple.  Just lift up on it and push (one hand operation).  That\'s good enough for us since we\'re dealing with dogs, but it has a safety that you engage with a simple twist that adds a second step to opening the gate if you\'re dealing with clever little kids.One reviewer commented that they were somehow challenged by the ""assembly""......  I don\'t know what to say about that (or them).... This thing is SUPER easy to install!!  It was up and swinging 10 mins out of the box.  I didn\'t even read the instructions.Get it, you won\'t regret it!",NA
"1757","Mamas &amp; Papas Baby Snug Activity Tray","I love this activity tray that fits on the Mama & Papa chair. I would not purchase from Amazon, though, because it is cheaper elsewhere. However, it really is a great addition to the Mama & Papa chair. It\'s colorful, which my son loves, and there are several ""activities"" on it that he can enjoy. Sometimes this will keep him busy for up to 30 minutes. It\'s great if I need to cook dinner or fold laundry and need him to be entertained for a bit. He LOVES the red ball that spins and makes noise. Some of the parts have nubby bumps on them, and he likes that, too.My only somewhat complaint is that it doesn\'t stick TOO well to the try. It does have suction cups, and it lasts for a bit, but I find that sometimes my son himself can detach the attachment. This isn\'t a huge deal, though, and I still give it 5 stars.",5

The thermometers that take the temperature in your ear constantly change their reading. This is not the case here. To test accuracy, I checked my temperature even when healthy and compared it to the good old-fashioned thermometers that just take longer to give a read out than I prefer.",5
"1760","Prince Lionheart bebePOD floor seat, Yellow","As soon as my baby turned 3 mos and was able to hold her head up very well we tried it out and it was fun to see her sit up right in front you when just 3 months ago she couldn\'t even lift her head on her own. Now at 5 months my baby can\'t sit on her own but loves sitting in it but not too long. I\'m excited to start feeding her rice cereal and using the tray attachment. She tends to lean to the side though on it which bothers me and she won\'t stay in it on her own too long. She\'d rather crawl/scoot on her floor mat so it\'s going to be more for a temporary place to sit, especially when starting solids. My baby\'s a bit on the slender side but I can see how this is better for thicker thighed babies. But I\'m wondering if the Bumbo would\'ve held my baby better because her thighs aren\'t as chubby.",NA

It\'s a little pricey when there\'s so many other things to purchase for baby. I looked into several other options, but wasn\'t satisfied with anything else. Other bags had lower quality material and were not as functional. The difference with this bag is definitely the fabric. The glazed finish is awesome and will help the bag last longer. It wipes clean easily and I absolutely love the print. There are lots of pockets on the interior that make things easy to find. The stroller straps are great for shopping trips.

"1763","Orbit Baby Infant Car Seat and Base G2, Black","I bought the Orbit system for its green, non-toxic properties.  I have been satisfied with the soft, comfortable, green materials on the interior.  My main problem with the seat is its weight.  It is extremely heavy.  I have started using the stroller to bring my daughter into stores, even for very brief trips where I wanted to just carry the car seat.  Also, you can\'t purchase small stroller frames like the Baby Trend to transport the car seat because of Orbit\'s unique base.  I have found it a bit cumbersome to always have to use the Orbit stroller with the car seat.My daughter, who is 2 months old, does not like taking car rides, but I don\'t know if this is b/c of the Orbit or for other reasons.Overall, I would purchase this seat again because of its non-toxic properties and because of the overall Orbit system (see separate review).Safety note:  the car seat has a loop in front that you use to tighten the straps.  It is easy to trip on this loop if the car seat is sitting on the floor.  I almost tripped on it and my husband tripped on it while carrying our baby.  Be aware of this if you make this purchase.",4

"1767","Eddie Bauer Trail Hiker 3 Wheel Travel System RED","As stated in the description this is simply a 3 wheel hiker, it does not say anything about being a jogging stroller.  I have a sit n stand that is like pushing a bus and the wheels are hard to straighten out with any weight at all, so being compared to that, this thing moves like a breeze.  I don\'t know how other reviewers say it folds flat because I can only get it to fold in half where it can stand on all the wheels. This is an excellent feature, but you need a large trunk/suv - I have one of my seats folded down in my SUV for this thing, it folds wider than my double stroller.  The back wheels are wide, which helps the stability, but is a bit difficult to maneuver through a mall or other crowded areas.The carrier is longer than most, I have a graco that my 5 month old seems to be starting to outgrow, and put my son in this one when I picked it up, and he has so much more room to grow in this, so I\'d say it will last a while in keeping little one safe.  I have seen reviews that say the baby leans forward, but you can adjust the base to align the ball in the alignment tool on the side of the seat - no big deal.  Overall it is a good quality stroller/carseat combo it just takes some getting used to.",NA

We bought this stroller to take on vacation and have been test driving it ahead of time. It is very easy to put together and handles like a dream. It is a little on the heavy side and takes a bit of muscle to snap it into place but once it is done it is awesome. It folds up quite small and will be a great asset in airports. We have an almost 5 year old and almost 2 year old and they both fit comfortably...our 5 year old walks most places, of course, but when she gets tired she quite enjoys chilling and being pushed around.

However, I have used the mittens on my newborn since I brought him home and they work really well although he is able to take them off on his own even though he is a newborn so maybe they are not as well fitting as I would have liked. The doggy is a cute addition to this set as a security blanket.",5
"1776","Skip Hop Duo Deluxe Diaper Bag Limited Edition, Edgewood","I bought this as I had had one when my kids were and nappies and loved it as a diaper bag. Then a friend with a 4 yr old and 7 yr old came to visit and was now using hers as an airplane bag and raving about it. So I bought a clean fresh one to use as she does for iPads, colouring (book and crayons pencil case), bottle of water first aid kit, small restaurant toys (figurines), it is fantastic! I keep it at the ready for restaurant outings, airplane trips, keeping little ones occupied during older ones activity classes. It is my total go to bag. It looks great has all the pockets to be organised can be hands free! It has it all! So well worth the investment as a diaper bag ( it is the best one I had - 3 kids and went through 5 diaper bags) and has a wonderful extended life as a travel/ day or night out with the kids bag! Very highly recommend! Stylish and very practical!Would even say Skip Hop could adapt this great model and make a bag to be used with older kids.",NA

"1778","Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym","I bought this as a gift for my niece. The detachable toys are a hit--the monkey is her favorite toy and is taken with her everywhere. She seems to really like the music as well. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the mat is not as large as I would like (one roll and she us up against the bar), it does not fold up and store as easily as the Tiny Love mat that I had for my son and the mat is thin (but they all are so you need a blanket underneath if you don\'t have a carpet).

"1788","UPPAbaby Plum VISTA Stroller","I guess what most people look for in a review are the cons, so I\'ll start there.  This stroller is huge, making it less than ideal if you are looking to put it in the trunk of a car.  Sometimes I catch the rear wheels on stuff--but they are what give it a great smooth ride. They are also solid instead of inflatable, which means no maintainence.It folds pretty compactly if you take the seat off, but it isn\'t necessary.  The seat is reversible giving you the option of being able to see your baby while pushing it.It would also be nice if it included a cup holder or child\'s tray.  I purchased a Baby Jogger cup holder and installed it--which is a bit of a pain.  The pockets inside of the basket hold drinks fine, but it would still be nice not to have to bend over.Everything is removable, which is usually great, but sometimes my wheels come off when folding it.  It only takes 1 second to put them on, but I fear really losing one when gate checking it at the airport.It is supposed to be easy to fold, but this took me a while to actually figure out.  It is very simple once you understand it, but I\'m impatient and didn\'t read the instructions.Some great things.  I love, love, love that the bassinet is included.  However, you probably won\'t get too much use out of it if you use it for your baby, I think it\'s supposed to be used until they are 15 lbs.  I however, never follow these rules and put both my 6 month old and 2 yo in it together.  The older one just sits with his legs straight out and the baby sits between them.  I also have the optional footboard that my 5 year old stands on.  I can push the Vista with all 3 kids in/on it with minimal effort.  If it\'s just the baby, its really easy to steer and push one handed.  Seriously, its the best ride of any stroller I\'ve tried (and I\'ve owned at least 7 or 8).The colors are great, although a little more subdued in person.  It was really hard to find a purple stroller, so it made me so happy to find the Vista.  Unfortunately, it\'s been discontinued in the 2009 lineup.The adjustable height handle is a lifesaver.  No more stooping over again.  Everything is washable, which is great for the mattress cover in the bassinet, since my baby tends to be leaky.  It also reverses from a breathable side to a warmer microfiber/sueded side, which would probably be nice in a cooler climate (not for this FL gal).And best of all, it just plain looks cool.  It\'s a head turner of a stroller and who doesn\'t love being envied?  Unless of course, some steals it, which is always on my mind when we are at Disney.So if you have a place for a larger, sturdy stroller with a super easy ride, this is a fantastic choice and one you don\'t see every mom in town pushing.",4

This is absolutely perfect!The sizing is great (I was a 36C before, somewhere around a DD or E now, and ordered the L/XL size).  The velcro pieces are wonderful, the sizing is remarkably flexible and well thought out.  The nipple shields stay perfectly in place, and there\'s enough support to hold onto the bottles I pump into (so far it\'s taken about 6 oz of weight, I assume there won\'t be a problem if/when I\'m pumping more).I\'m very easily able to use the computer or talk on the phone, etc... only limited by the length of the tubing now.I couldn\'t have asked for a better product!",5

Purchased this one while in North Florida to be delivered to Big Sandy, MT (middle of nowhere).  Shipping and delivery was expedited by Amazon - as usual!  My Grandson slept on this mattress as a baby and toddler for five years.  His toddler sister is now using it. The first one has held up to jumping, rolling, and two Grandchildren so far.

"1801","Infantino Sash Mei Tai Carrier Black/Gray","I bought one of these to try out because of the reasonable price, and because our Ergo was not working for my 2 month/13#/25&#34; baby as well as planned. Here is what I like about the mei tai vs the Ergo:-Taller panel gives him head support - he likes to tilt his head back and look around and with the ergo I have to hold it with one hand since he is still a little wobbly. This lets him just rest it against the support and still look around. This won\'t be a problem once he has better head control but the ergo is definitely too short for now.-Easier to put on - it\'s always difficult for me to clip the shoulder strap when I have the ergo on alone-Price is definitely a plus! Especially if you are new to babywearing and are not sure which one you might like.-More lightweight than the canvas for the ergo-The sides of the panel are padded, so he is comfortable with his legs out even at this relatively small age. In the ergo he is too big for the infant insert but too small to have his legs comfortably out.Some might find the Ergo easier to adjust (you can just pull straps vs tying and untying) and it definitely is sturdier. So far I have not tested out either on very long walks.",4

This bed rail is perfect for my daughter. I was worried with the way it is set up that it wouldn\'t be sturdy enough, but my daughter has leaned on it and pulled on it and it doesn\'t move much once it is in place. She even seems to sleep up against it at night, so she must feel safe and secure. It is easy to change the sheets, I don\'t even have to move the rail at all. I have left the wood unfinished and it is fine. It is smooth to the touch and I haven\'t had a problem with any splinters. I have had blankets over it and have not had any snagging. I see no problem with it being unfinished, other than it not matching the crib\'s finish exactly.

"1810","Adiri BPA Free Natural Nurser Ultimate Bottle Stage 1 White, Slow Flow (0-3 months)","I sheepishly admit to buying the Adiri Bottle for its design value first, effectiveness second. That being said, it\'s the first bottle we\'ve tried, so we don\'t have much to compare it to, but pleasantly, it works well for us. I like the top being more breast-like in look and feel (for a hesitant one-month old baby that initially gave it the stink eye, but warmed up to it after a few minutes), and whether the petals are good in terms of baby taking less air (compared to other bottles), again unsure. But it does cause more burping than from the breast. A big turnoff for some will be that the bottle can\'t go into a bottle warmer (because the air valve at bottom will leak and/or the size of bottle), but we often store our milk in the breast-pump bottles or snappies containers and use these with the warmer.Addendum: After a few months (month 6), the babe drank less and less milk. I thought it was possibly a self-weaning, but turns out it was the bottle that was the problem. We switched to Born Free Glass Bottles and the babe seems to like this much better and  thankfully daily milk consumption went from 2oz to 23oz. Now I know why parents seem to have some many brands of the same stuff. . . . sometimes the babe just doesn\'t like it and parents are forced to try another . . . and another.  This was just my kid\'s experience. Yours might be different.",2

Not very practical as your child gets older (over 1) and you start to pack less (well, learn to pack less).2. no insulated bottle pockets - we have to pack a separate cooler for our bottles.3. designed with deep pockets. You have to really dig underneath all of the crap to get to the objects in the pockets.

Also, we have a queen size bed and both my wife and I have a good amount of room to sleep.

She would eventually put down the regular spoon and proceed to eat with her hands.  After reading reviews, we decided to give the Beaba 360 a try.

It also does a much better job of mixing the formula, it seems to give it a completely different texture (in a good way).  I\'ve read some reviews that it\'s flimsy.  Thruthfully, I\'ve washed it as directed in the top of the dishwasher and had no issues.  Even if it did, I\'d just shell out another 10..it\'s a small price for the ease it provides.",5

I had never heard of this company before, then I went to a car seat installation safety technician at a local hospital and he recommended the Recaro Pro Sport.  He said that the safety features surpass all of the Britax models and that this seat has the highest capacity on the market as of today.  I am SO glad that I took his advice.  First, it is SUPER comfortable.  It has a thick, plush seat and is quite wide.  Because I was more familiar with the mainstream combo car seats, I had already purchased two Gracos and two Britax Marathons.  I only wish I had discovered the Recaro company sooner.  I am now selling one of my Marathons.  It\'s also very easy to install and everything\'s color coded.  I cannot say enough good things about this car seat!  The only drawback might be that there is no cup holder (like the Britax Frontier 70) but that\'s okay b/c my kids didn\'t have a cup holder w/their Marathons or their Chicco KeyFit 30s so they are used to just passing them back to me.",5

With the newer Avent bottles on the market (the four ounce blue ones) my son is able to get every drop out of the bottle when eating. When I go to clean the bottles and pour whatever formula is left in them, there is never anything to pour out because my son has drank every drop in the bottle.

BUT they work and they don\'t show through the bra (unless you\'re wearing a really flimsy cotton bra, then you can make out the circles.) If you are really set on having the kind that stick to your bra, then don\'t buy these, but I find that I don\'t even use the stickers if I do have that kind.

"1840","Leachco Back \'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","This is so comfortable and helped greatly when I was pregnant.  It\'s so comfortable, that if it didn\'t take up so much room in the bed, I would sleep with it all the time!",5
"1841","BooginHead SippiGrip, Boy Camo","My son (1 year old) likes to throw things from the high chair all the time.  This strap fits nicely around his metal insulated straw cup we use for water at meal times.  The cup doesn\'t have any sort of &#34;waist&#34; or skinny part to it to fit the strap around, but still the rubbery/grippy stuff on this strap holds it tight.  Great buy and I\'ve already ordered another one!",5
"1842","Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo","My 4.5 month old loves this jumperoo! I got it shipped internationally all the way to India after I read the rave reviews and I wasnt disappointed at all!

"1845","Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse","This is our second highchair for our third child.  I despised our other chair, the Graco Harmony High Chair. I really like the Contempo chair.What I like:1) The print blends nicely with our kitchen decor.2) I love that there are two chair pads and I can wash them on gentle cycle in cold water and air dry.  They come out beautifully.  Being able to take the pad off allows for me to clean in all the underside nooks and crannies where things like cheerios hide.  Another review I read said that it is hard to clean but I disagree.  Taking the pads off is not intuitive but when the directions are followed to a T it is surprisingly easy.  We lost our instruction manual but I was able to print a new one from the GRACO webpage so I can refresh my memory if I need to.3)  This really does fold fairly flat - much needed for our small space.  We were even able to fold it and put it in our van and take it to our in-laws for the holidays last year.4)  We can pull this chair right up to our kitchen table when the tray isn\'t attached and our little guy loves being at the table with everybody.5)  There have been complaints about the straps.  I haven\'t had problems with the straps - they\'ve been fine.What I didn\'t like:1)  Our baby\'s arm kept getting caught between the chair and the top of the leg rests. He was never hurt - it just startled both of us! There are other reviews describing this same problem.  We resolved it my rolling up a receiving blanket and putting it in the space. Now that he is bigger - just turned one - it is no longer an issue for him. However, it should not have been an issue at all in the first place.  This issue is why I gave the chair four stars instead of five.  If Graco could fix this design flaw this would be an outstanding high chair.",4

Overall great purchase!",5
"1854","Candide Baby Group Smart Folding Play Mat - Puzzle","Perfect for casual baby/toddler naps, nicely made.  This is soft and light.  It would not be suitable as a tumbling mat as the stuffing is thick cotton batting, but not dense foam.  It is likely too soft to use for a newborn/younger infant. It is perfect for an older infant who can sit up, roll and crawl as well as for toddlers--although it is soft and light, it is cushioned enough to support a napping baby (our son weighs about 27 pounds and is very comfortable on it).  The mat weighs probably less than 2-3 pounds. You can use it all spread out as a large square (opened to all four squares), or fold it in half so it\'s a double-thickness rectangle 2 squares long, or fold it again so it\'s a quadruple-thickness single square and use it as a floor cushion/seat for a toddler. As a large square or a rectangle it\'s perfect for older infants and toddlers to nap, or just a soft spot to play, look at books and relax, and it\'s low enough to the ground that they won\'t get hurt if they roll off of it.  Since it is not a crib or portable crib and there are no walls, of course any napping on it should be done with adult supervision and/or using the mat in a safe spot like a small fenced-in indoor play area enclosure. The tag on the product doesn\'t state the country of manufacture.  It\'s a French company. Per their website, they source some materials from Asia and they have manufacturing plants in Tunisia and France.  The removable fabric cover is a soft 50/50 cotton/polyester.  The stuffing is 100% cotton and the backing (bottom of the mat that rests on the floor) is waterproof PVC so you can use it outside.  The cover zips off and is machine washable.  You must insert a paper clip to use as a zipper pull; this is a safety feature to keep kids from unzipping it.  The attached handles are made of fabric. We got this as we were looking for a portable nap mat to carry around the house or easy to take in the car, with a breathable and machine washable fabric cover.  We\'ve had it about 4 months in nearly daily use with no problems.We also have a Thomas the Train baby seat that looks like a small sofa that pulls out to a nap mat, purchased from toys r us, but we don\'t like it for our baby yet since when he naps on there, his head gets sweaty on the synthetic cover, and the cover is not removable and not washable so you can only spot clean it in case of drool, spills, leaks, etc.  Also, our baby is not yet standing up and walking on his own, although he can ""cruise""--walk around the room by holding onto furniture, and he sometimes tries to hold onto or crawl over the Thomas seat and ends up falling forward on his head.  So we put the Thomas seat away for now but I am sure we will use it regularly in the future when our son is a toddler and can use it as a little sofa without tumbling off the front or over the back.  In the meantime, this Candide mat fits our needs perfectly.",NA

Just like someone else said in the reviews that the plastinc band in the middle of the ball is hard and my child did end up hitting herself in the head with it, which ok not a great thing to have happen but wasn\'t a big deal, she cried a bit and got over it. She just never really played with it or found it intertaining in any way, but every child is different. I can\'t say that it\'s bad in the way it was manufactured or the looks or anything. We\'re expecting a second child, maybe he\'ll like the toy better.",3

Your husband wont love it cuz it makes cuddling almost impossible but if you are in pain...he will survive.I give 4 stars cuz its a little too hard for my head. i wake up with an ear ache from laying on it.

"1867","Parents Choice - Diapers, count 50, Size 1","I really like this diaper. I actually don\'t use them for a baby, I use them for my chihuahua and poodle. They\'re not incontinent, but they like to sneak off and pee and poo in the house sometimes. Anyway, I had tried the expensive disposable doggy diapers, with no luck. They leaked, and the tabs lost their stickiness, and just didn\'t stay on good. I finally decided to try baby diapers and I went to Walmart and got these. I like how the tabs are like velcro, which allows me to take the diaper on and off during the day when I take them out to potty. I keep using the same diaper until it gets soiled or just falls apart from wear and tear. Plus they\'re cost effective. The doggy diapers were nearly 12 bucks for 16 worthless diapers. But with these, I can buy 50 of these for basically 6 dollars. I think they\'re like 5.79 or something like that. You get more for your money. Plus, they just work better. They fit my dogs better, and work just as well as an expensive name brand like Huggies or Pampers. All I have to do is cut a hole for my chihuahua\'s tail to come through, and for my little poodle, I just leave it like it is. The only reason I didn\'t give it five stars is because they seem to run a little small. I bought newborn for my litttle poodle puppy, and size 1 for my chihuahua. In other brands newborn and size 1 were a bit bigger, so, I\'m going to have to go up a size for each of them. Anyway, great product! I\'ll most likely be using these when I do have kids some day. But right now, I\'ll use them for my fur babies :)",4

"1870","babyletto Grayson Mini Crib with Mattress Pad, Espresso","I spent a lot of time looking at mini cribs before deciding on this one. Most other brands seemed flimsy. I wanted a ""real"" crib from the first day we brought baby home that would fit in our bedroom. My first child slept so much better on a real mattress compared to a bassinet or pack-n-play. This crib has two level options which is nice for the first few months. The 3 inch mattress works great and it is not recommended to use anything thicker if you plan to use the top level. I also purchased a breathable bumper (mini-crib size) which also fits great. The wood is beautiful and the manufacturing quality is good. We purchased and assembled about 8 weeks before baby arrived. It took about an hour to assemble. It did have a bit of an odor for the first few weeks so I am glad we did this ahead of time. Baby is now six months old and still has plenty of room and she is no shrimp (90% in length). I anticipate she will be able to stay in it for 18 months and maybe more if she is not a crib jumper. I am completely satisfied with this purchase and glad I did not go with a cheaper option.",5

I love it so much I wanted to have two so I could keep one in the car. I\'m still nursing my son who will be 1 year in three weeks. The pillow still has tons of room for him to grow if I continue to nurse him past the 1 year mark :) I have recommended this pillow to all my friends and family who are currently breastfeeding. I give this pillow a 10/10, 5 stars isn\'t enough!",5
"1873","Evenflo Soft And Wide Gate Taupe &amp; Chocolate","I purchased this gate because like others, i did not want to drill holes in my oak railing. This was great for the bottom of our stairs. I\'m only 5 ft tall and it was fairly easy for me to step over, even while holding my son. It did tend to rub paint off of the wall. When my son reached about 18 mos, he could pretty easily put his weight against it and knock it over. He also figured out how to pull the bottom out and crawl under.This also worked well to keep our small dog from going upstairs, but my 5 month old lab could knock it over.",4

"1875","Kawaii Baby Ultra Soft One Size Pocket Cloth Diaper with 2 Inserts &quot;Blue Water&quot;","I ordered this and the rocket bamboo charcoal Kawaii to try out and see which I wanted to use. It\'s nice that it\'s waterproof and it\'s inserts dry quickly but the legs leak for some reason every single poop. The bamboo Kawaii does not. This diaper doesn\'t stain and feels nice but as the other reviewer says, it is a bit bulky but so is the bamboo Kawaii so I think that\'s just something you get with this brand. My son is in the 95 percentile for weight by the way so it\'s weird he\'s leaking out the legs with this diaper having such chunky thighs. It may be just the one I received since I only ordered one, but something to keep in mind. Overall for being in a budget and wanting some easy to maintain, durable, plain brightly colored diapers, they\'re a good way to go.",NA

The pattern is neutral5. The music is real music!! And it has nature sounds as well. My daughter loves those.6. She can either swing from side to side or front to back.7.

I looked at several different brands and styles of bouncers before deciding on this one.  I like that the toy arms pivot so you don\'t have to awkwardly put the baby in the bouncer under an attached toy arm or have to remove it first, like all other bouncers.  I also like that you can put other toys on the arms to make it more interesting to a child and that you can pivot the arms to the appropriate angle for a child to see or grab at a toy.  It is also a less expansive bouncer which I like because my son didn\'t use it for more than 5 or 6 months.  I highly recommend this bouncer!",5

It bunches up!  Placing an infant in this basket would be a grave mistake!  Also, when first removed from the box, it had an awful chemical smell!I had this basket shipped directly to a friend upon the birth of her grandson.  She was appalled at the quality and told me she would NEVER put her grandson or any other infant inside this basket!

I was a little concerned about the safety since since the product description does not include some of the information like BPA free etc. She puts these toys in her mouth but upon researching a little bit I found that Sassy toys are safe.I just wish it was easier to get more water in some of the smaller toys that would make squirting more fun for me :).",4

"1908","Safety 1St Comfy Cushy 3-in-1 Potty","I bought this potty to replace theSafety 1st Potty \'n Step Stoolthat we used to have. It was a great potty but my two year old cracked the seat, from using it as a step to reach the sink, and we had to toss it. While I like that it is very cushy, that same cushy bit is the part that sticks to her bottom sometimes, when she stands up, if it is stuck to her then when it falls off her bottom into the potty it is not fun. Other than that it\'s great. The lid is the step stool in this case and it\'s just about the right height for her to reach the sink.The only flaws are that the bowl is rather large, and my sink is small, if you have a tub or a bigger sink, it should be fine. Also we have the extended bowl toilets and this potty seat doesn\'t work so well with it. How I miss the round toilets from the old house...I also have three other potties for my daughter, one of which, the The First Years - Pooh 3-in-1 Flush & Sounds Potty, we really don\'t like. The cup is inset into the seat and when it sticks (and it does, a lot) the ensuing mess is very gross.",4

I can\'t believe the peace of mind I\'ve gotten from buying this.  I would recommend everyone get one of these!  I have two sisters who are both expecting, and my parents are thinking about buying them each one for their new little bundles.  It\'s so portable, and small.  My son was just over 5 lbs. when I bought it, and it fit just fine over his little diaper.It\'s uncomfortable to sit him up with it on, so we usually take it on and off him when we get him out of the crib, but if I put him in his swing, I just clip it to him again, and don\'t worry.I would totally recommend this item for ANYONE with a baby.",5

"1933","Momo Baby Travel Bowl and Spoon Set, Green","This is very handy for feeding my baby solid foods while we\'re out-and-about, when a bowl and spoon are needed.  The spoon snaps into a neat little compartment in the lid of the bowl, so you can just toss the whole thing in your diaper-bag and rest assured that the head of the spoon will stay safe and sanitary until baby is ready to eat.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the spoon is a bit wide, but my 10-month-old manages it just fine, and she\'s on the petite side.  It might be an issue if your baby\'s mouth is very small, but even then, the size of the spoon shouldn\'t be problematic if you make sure to scoop the food onto the edge of the spoon.  Plus, the bowl & spoon are BPA-free and phthalate-free, which are safety bonuses.  I definitely recommend this product if you\'re looking for an easy, sanitary way to spoon-feed your little one while on-the-go.",4

"1936","UPPAbaby G-Lite and G-Luxe Stroller Rain Cover","This cover is made with PVC plastic, which contains toxic chemicals. While it may be phthalate-free PVC, PVC plastic still needs some free-floating (in other words: can seep out of the plastic to baby) toxic chemical in order to remain supple. So, no matter that it\'s ""phthalate-free"" (a pointless buzz term used to placate parents in these safety-conscious times)...any flexible PVC ultimately contains toxins that can seep out and cause permanent harm to a baby.My greatest complaint is that this information was not provided anywhere on this Amazon listing, allowing me--and anyone else who may be concerned about plastic toxicity--to make an informed decision. I had to open the package in order to read it on the information booklet contained within the package.Buy this if you don\'t worry about such issues...but I wanted those parents who care about such issues to be forewarned about the PVC plastic in this product.",1

"1945","Recaro Vivo High Back Booster, Carbon","We purchased the Recaro Vivo Booster because our son was complaining about riding in a ""baby seat"" and he just eclipsed the 40lb mark.  He was riding in a Britax Marathon and I liked that seat because of the plushness and comfort it provided for him.  It seemed all the boosters I was seeing looked and felt cheap and hard.  This seat is the exception!  It is very soft with the velvet and cloth cover.My son is a smaller child and I was concerned some of the other boosters might not hold him in.  This seat is perfect.  The seat is not too snug so there is room to grow.  He tends to fall asleep on our commute home so I like that the head ""wings"" support his head when he\'s napping.  This seat is very light and easy to install.  The recline feature is handy as we move it from vehicle to vehicle.  The headrest also adjusts so it can grow with the child.  I am a fan of the belt position as it lays nicely in his lap thanks to the grooves that are on each side of the seat. All in all this seat is a steal for this price. If you are even considering a high back booster BUY THIS ONE!  It is well worth the money.",5

She would bat at the toys starting around 4 months, and within a couple months could grab the music ring.  I thought around 10-12 months that I would put the chair away, then she suddenly started crawling in and out of it, bringing books and toys with her.  She\'s 2 now, and still loves this chair.  It\'s a great height for her still, as a skinny thing, she\'ll be well within the weight limits for another year or two, and I\'ll probably keep it out for her.  One of the best plus\' for me was that it breaks down so flat.  I\'ve actually taken this with me on a couple of trips- fits in the bottom of a suitcase easily and relatively flat, so easy to pack around.  I had a conference when little girl was 3.5 months that my Mom accompanied me on the trip- it let my Mom get showers in the hotel to keep LG entertained and contained, and then a month or two later, went on vacation, brought it with us- let my husband and I relax a little or cook while she was cooing away in her chair.

I fill the unit with dry clothes and add about 3 cups of warm water with a tablespoon and baby wash and a couple of drops of tea tree oil (natural antibacterial).  I use all of the wipes and then wipe down the unit and start fresh.  When I first started using it I would just keeping adding wipes and water daily and that\'s when I would get the funk.  You don\'t want the same water hanging out in this thing for a week.  If you can keep up with that you\'ll be very happy with the wipe warmer.

I usually leave the bottles in the sterilizer until I need to use them since taking them out and leaving them on the dish rack to dry seems ""unclean.""

I only pump one side at a time and have not tried to pump both sides at the same time.  I usually nurse my daughter then pump off the rest and the opposite breast in the morning and at night and usually get between 8-12 oz in about 30 minutes each time.  I really think that using this pump has contributed to my crazy milk supply.

But I was so greatful for this product.  I even found an old beatup carried in a department store. Someone used it well.  I gave both my carriers away to other moms in need and now I am pregnant again with my third child and I will not hesitate buying another Baby Bjorn carrier.",5
"1969","Yookidoo Tote Along Musical Mirror Toy","My baby took an instant liking to this toy - it captured his attention and kept it!The giraffe toy is colorful and rattlesThe ""tote"" bag can hold much much more than the giraffe which makes it both a great toy and a handy carry-all for an outing to someone\'s house or in the car, when you need to keep a child occupied  (I don\'t recommend it for travel).The bag stands upright on a plastic base (where the batteries are housed), plays several different songs and the faces light up in time with the music.The round plastic clips on the bottom are perfect for attaching stroller toys, dangling rattles, etc.The bottom of the bag and the inside of the bag contain short cords for securing to the side of a crib or play yard, making it a great visual stimuli / activity center.All in all, this item is a GREAT value and I\'m planning on purchasing it for all of my friends having babies!",5
"1970","Deluxe Music In Motion Developmental Mobile W Remote","My daughter is 8 weeks and has loved this since since she has been a week old. She will lay in her crib watching this for over 20 minutes at a time. She just waves her arms and legs and making the cutest faces. I love the way there mobile pauses for her to focus and the color contrast is perfect for her.  I change my daughter in her crib now so that when I am done she will stay in there and play!!!  My only complaint is that it doesn\'t get any quieter and that it makes a clicking noise as it rotates. But she loves it so that is all that matters. I would recommend this to anyone!!!I have to edit this. When my daughter was around 8 months old the mobile stopped working. I think that for $35 this should have lasted longer. However, my daughter did love it. I just wanted to caution anyone who might be looking to purchase this product.",5

"1973","Baby Deedee Sleep Nest Baby Sleeping Bag, Dream Blue, Small (0-6 Months)","We have Halo, Summer Infant & Baby Deedee. We preferred the Halo over the Summer Infant because it was nice to have a separate piece for the arms since our baby din\'t like having his arms swaddled after he was about 2 months old. The Halo is nice because you can swaddle their arms, keeping them warmer. However, we found the Halo to just not be warm enough. With the Baby Deedee Sleep Nest, my son\'s hands are FINALLY warm at night. I do dress him in a long-sleeve onsie and/or fleece pajamas on top of that before putting him in the Baby Deedee. At night our place is between 66 - 68 degrees. We try not to run the heat too much since it gets so dry.Another thing I really like about the Baby Deedee is that the arm holes are small (there are snaps, so you never have a problem putting it on). I feel it keeps my little babe warmer. The Halo arm holes are quite large (which is necessary so that you can get their arms in and out!). And, the Halo\'s fleece is just NOT as warm as this.I am incredibly happy with this purchase and would buy it again in a heartbeat! Don\'t let the price deter you -- it\'s worth it.",5

In addition to having the base in the second car, we\'ve used the extra base on airline travels and extended grandparent visits. It also helped us to delay the cost of a second car seat for a year -- I would carry my child and the bucket seat into the day care and my husband would pick them up.",5

We ordered it hoping to shift it from a changing table to a dresser when our son got older, but it has not even lasted for a changing table. We are looking for a replacement and this one will be going in the trash, as it is not even repairable. We are so frustrated and disappointed, as we thought we were buying something of decent quality, and it has just been a hassle.",1
"1978","Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters","I have purchased this and the Babycomfynose. I purchased the Babycomfynose first when my baby was smaller, and really loved it. As my son got older, I realized that the tube on it was too long. It curls up and twists up easy and got some kinks in it, making it not work properly and hard to use since he doesn\'t just lay there anymore. He is 16 months old now and I\'ve used the Nosefrida since he was about 1 year. I am really happy with it. He doesn\'t like anything up his nose, but it is so much easier and safer than the bulb. It also allows you to get all the yuck out fast so he\'s not uncomfortable for long. You are supposed to replace the filter with every use, which is an added price there that the Babcomfynose doesn\'t have. I personally don\'t replace it every time but wash them. Would recommend!",5

Go with the Prince Lionhart brand.  The cushion on the stone on my fireplace is stuck nice and tight even through tons of pulling and chewing.

I owned this monitor for 3 years before having the repetitive &#34;not linked&#34; issue that so many have written about. So I did not hesitate to visit Amazon to purchase another .Pros:Two parent monitors ( I have one place in the master bedroom and the other in the basement)Belt clips on the parent monitors (handy for hooking the monitor onto clothes and allowing me to be hands free)Two -way communication-- This is my favorite feature of this monitor!  I love being able to communicate with my son(22 months old) to let him know that I hear him and am on my way.Cons:  I honestly cannot think of any.All in all, if you are looking for a monitor that allows you to communicate with your child I would recommend this product.",5

At 7mos. my son was already pulling up and trying to escape and I needed something that I thought would contain him a bit better.  I researched many options and thought this would be the best choice.  This tub served the purpose of helping contain my son, but like some of the other reviewers, I had the problem of getting a tear along the seam behind the drainplug rendering it useless.",2
"1994","Bright Starts Hop Along Friends Play Gym","My son started playing with this when he was around two-months-old and still enjoys playing with it at six-months-old.  His favorite attachment is the plush frog.  He will play with the other toys for short periods of time but quickly gets bored with them.  All of the toys are easily detachable so you can switch them out for other toys.  We switch the toys quite frequently to keep my son interested in this play gym.The mat portion of this is fairly thin and does not have a lot of cushioning.  It\'s therefore best to use this on a carpeted floor or on top of a foam play mat.The leaves on the mat can be lifted up of the mat.  They make a crinkling sound when you touch them.",NA

"2001","EvenFlo SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer","I bought this for my 4 month old son because of the good reviews and cool look of the play center.  First, you need a ton of batteries as everything is lighted and musical. Although this wouldn\'t normally be considered a bad thing, in this application it seems very gimicky and serves as a replacement for well thought-out and imaginitive toys.  The best single item on the center is the battery-powered and removable play box that has turnable pages.  Everything else really gets old quickly (pop up apple box, twisty turtle man, useless cell-phone toy, boring ball roller...).The layout is very busy with poorly spaced toys blending together that seem to be overwhelming to the child.  The 3 butterfly domes serve as shock towers and really aren\'t much fun to play with.  The arch thing was fun for about 3 pulls of each hanging toy.Pros: Folding capability, interchangable toysCons: Boring and uninteresting toys,  too much reliance on gimicky lights, music, and mechanical features (pop-up apple thing), expense.Save your cash and go with the Baby Einstein center. My son can play in that one for over 20 minutes versus 5 in this one.",2

I anxiously awaited for the BM of the AM as I got out of bed, brushed my teeth...  then my tummy got the signal. My heart jumped and my legs skipped to the Squatty Potty waiting brightly under the toilet and for the first time my feet and SP met. Not only did it keep my feet warm and off the cold tile, the movement of the intestines was as smooth as a baby\'s just powdered butt.I wanted to tell the world. THIS MAKES A DIFFERENCE. Without the SP, it\'s like popcorn without the butter, it might taste decent, but it is best with butter. Or kayaking without a paddle-it will work if you use your hands to paddle and work hard, almost to exertion or you can just sit there and wait.I\'ve told several people of this invention that all households should have. People are speechless and give me this dumbfounded look. Either they don\'t have a clue what I am talking about or they think I am crazy to get so excited over a bowel movement device/helper. I don\'t care. I know people who will understand.I will cherish this Christmas because it was the Christmas true friends gave me the gift of the Squatty Potty.

My two year old loves the size and is thrilled to make very tall towers. I was unsure about which ""jumbo"" foam blocks to purchase but speaking now from experience, I highly recommend these. The thinner (less expensive) versions would be much harder to balance and the smaller ones wouldn\'t have the same impact. I also was torn between 16 and 32 quantity packs but at this stage/age, 16 is just right. It is surprising how much large foam blocks cost but after searching the internet, I was hard-pressed to find a less expensive source!",5

"2007","Lambs &amp; Ivy 5 Piece Bedding Set, Enchanted Forest","I love this set! It is a good quality set, nicely made quilt, with coordinating accessories. As a foster parent, never knowing if I will have a boy or girl, I feel this is neutral enough to work for either. Overall, I am extremely happy with this set and the accessories that I bought to go along with. I like the wrinkle free fabrics, it was nice to pull the bedskirt and sheet out of the washer and not have to iron it.I did only give 4 stars for two reasons - 1) When I washed the quilt, some of the fabrics used for the animals pilled pretty badly, and 2) I feel there could be some improvement in how to hang the diaper stacker. It would work fine on cribs that have a thin rail along the top, but mine does not so it hangs sloppily on the side of the crib. I also would have preferred to get something else in the bundle instead of the single curtain panel, but that\'s just me and that did not affect my rating.",4

"2010","Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes","because of the great reviews and I wanted my 12 mo old daughter to like it.  She LOVES to push buttons on her toys to play music so I thought this would be great for her to carry around.  But when she got it, she played with it for about 5 minutes, then tossed it aside.  We\'ve had it for 2 weeks now and she occasionally presses the button for the tunes, but I can tell its not her favorite toy.Few things I wished it had:-more buttons to press.  I think having just one big button to press gets boring for my daughter.-the volume has two settings.  Soft and VERY soft.  I strained a little to hear the melodies on the lowest setting.  Call me crazy, but I wouldn\'t mind another setting for medium.-songs.  Yes, I know the product description is for classical TUNES.  That\'s why I can\'t ding the Take Along Tunes for that.  I looked at buying Fisher price Laugh and learn music playerFisher-Price Laugh & Learn Learning Music Playerbut didn\'t because its more then twice the cost of the Take Along Tunes.  However, if my daughter doesn\'t show anymore interest in it, I may give this toy to my 1 year old niece and purchase the Fisher Price Music player to see if my daughter enjoys it more.Also, the lights that light up to the melody of the music are SUPER BRIGHT at night!  Bright enough to light up my baby\'s face and car seat!",3

The gates fastens to the wall using a screw-rod tension mechanism which is also easy to just slip into the end of the gate and then turn the wheel until it is securely fastened. The gate itself is tall and sturdy and the locking mechanism is sufficient to keep children at bay. The self-closing door is a very nice feature. Gate extension pieces come in many sizes form 3\' to 39.5\' allowing you to fit most any doorway. The only downside is that the smallest extension is 3"" so if your doorway is in between certain sizes you might have a slight problem. A 1.75"" extension would be a good addition from the manufacturer. All in all this is a great purchase and a great deal for the price.",5

She is almost two and has started using the potty in January but regressed with the birth of her baby sister. She has a little potty we got.her that is by summer infant, I think, that has a cushy seat and lid and toilet paper holder and turns into a step stool. She\'s used it but not consistently and has been freaking out when I even suggest it. I got this for.her after reading &#34;This is how I roll&#34; on my kindle from the Amazon marketplace. The author suggests only using these. So starting today we are in our &#34;Big girl potty week&#34; so hopefully she is potty trained in a few days. The seat and stand are made of a very hard thick plastic and rubber grip. It is well made and what I expected of such a product based on what I have seen in stores. The seat is best fitting for what I guess is a standard toilet seat. It\'s not very long so those extra long and wide seats may not be best for it. It fits ours in shape but the seat does move around in hole slightly. I just push it all the way back and it\'s fine. Not.wobbly enough for her to feel unsafe or scared.",5
"2039","Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair","I got this as a gift for Christmas, as this was when my son was about to turn 5 months old.People keep writing that their 16 pound baby does not have room to move or grow, , my baby is bigger than average and still has room to grow and is comfortable, not squished.The colors are nice, it is sturdy and easy to clean.I like the way it buckles together, it is very easy to get my son out of the seat.The directions say to push the tray onto the chair, much easier and nicer on the chair if you either pull the side handles or push the Fisher Price button on the front and slide it on.I do not like that it only has two wheels in the front, I wish it had two in the back also or something, it is very hard to move out of the way or to move period.Folding it up is difficult, as you have to LAY it down on its side (the directions tell you to do this as well) and then fold it, and then it DOES NOT lock. If you have a closet, maybe it does not matter to you that it does not fold but for someone without a closet to hide it away in, it makes it a little bit of a safety hazard if left folded but not propped in between things to hold the bottom from falling.I do like it though, i wanted this to match the Luv U Zoo Jumperoo.The seat cover does not seem to hold onto the seat very well, it says in the directions to insert side clips into slots on seat, but what slots are they talking about? If you try to put it anywhere besides where i have them, it does not work at all. So yes, I do have them in the right spot, it just does not hug the seat tightly.My son loves the colors, tries to look at the patterns and animals while eating in the chair.Good idea, but needs some improvements. I really wish it was easier to move.*******Had to send the seat to Fisher Price for manufacturing problem. The chair would not open and click into place unless i put my FULL (130 pounds) weight onto it. I did this for two days, the second day it would not even click open so I had to return it. Fisher Price was very helpful and sent me a refund check as soon as they received the chair. Not sure what the problem was, but the return was easy and they were very helpful.",2

"2042","Bumkins Waterproof Tote - Red Fat Farm","This makes a great ""wet bag"" for cloth diapers.  Before being filled, it folds or rolls up very small to fit in a diaper bag or purse. It will hold about 5 or 6 soiled cloth diapers, so it\'s perfect for a day long outing. Then, throw it in the wash with the cloth diapers to get it nice and clean.  I line dry it, and it dries very quickly. At this wonderful price, I got 2, so while one is on the line, the other is in my bag! The draw string and toggle closure close very tightly, keeping any odors inside the bag.  Best of all, I just open the bag and dump the diapers in the wash, without having to touch them!  I haven\'t used the mesh bag on the outside much, as I usually have a ""regular"" diaper bag with me.  I don\'t think it would hold many bulky cloth diapers (dry), though it could hold smaller, flatter things.  It holds a pack of disposable wipes, or a few cloth wipes, along with keys, thin wallet, phone...All in all, it fits the bill for what I wanted: a waterproof wetbag to hold dirty diapers while we\'re out and about, allowing me to continue cloth diapering even when I\'m not at home.",4
"2043","Peg Perego Venezia SNG Carriage / Stroller - Chesapeake","I LOVE this stroller! I am 5\'9&quot; and find no trouble using it in either position (front facing or child facing). It is EASY to break down and fits in the trunk of my car with a week\'s groceries. If you are unsure of the travel sys. vs stroller/separate car seat, go with the Venezia. Travel systems are bulky and only useful for a few months. I agree with the other 5* reviews--easy to use, manages great in small spaces (including cafes) and is so comfortable for Baby! This stroller is an excellent investment.",5

"2045","BABYBJORN Booster Chair, White","With my two older daughters I used the Cooshie booster seat for them from the time they were about a year and a half old.  One thing I always wished that seat offered was a strap to hold it on to the chair.  I also didn\'t like how the seat ruined the finish on my kitchen chair when my second daughter was using it.I was excited to check out this booster from Babybjorn.  The seat is nicely designed.  The booster can be securely attached to a kitchen chair.  I like the little rubber grippers on the bottom of the booster.  I think the design on the bottom will keep the seat from marring the finish on a chair if there happens to be a small spill.The booster is a hard plastic so shoes with buckles will not tear this seat up.  It will also be a snap to wipe down.  Of course, I do wonder how well the white plastic will hold up to foods that stain such as spaghetti sauce.The mechanism for the strap for this booster is interesting.  The strap winds up to store itself within the seat so you won\'t have loose straps dangling if you take this with you to eat out or visit family.  There is also a nice little handle moulded into the bottom of the seat for easy carrying.I have to say I am a bit shocked at the asking price for this booster.  It\'s nice, but there\'s no way I\'d spend nearly eighty dollars for it.  I suppose you\'re paying for the Baby Bjorn name.",4

It is the flagship model fro Britax with all the bells and whistles that would be expected in such a model. Its also big, the side impact padding makes it considerably wider than my previous Britax car seat.  This could be a concern in smaller cars and if weight is an issue. Overall, if you\'re looking to get a full featured car seat with extra safety and don\'t have space issues then this is a good choice.",NA

The cross joints on each panel have screws in them and the end of the screw ends up facing the inside of the play yard.  So if your baby stumbles and falls and happens to graze or heaven forbid hit that piece, it will likely cause serious injury. Also my son likes to sit and bounce up and down when he plays or gets excited and he tends to rock back sometimes and when he does his head is right at that screw level. So sadly we cannot use this.",2

We decided to purchase this seat b/c we have a pub height dining table that was too high for most hi-chairs.  This booster seat has been awesome.  The bottom inflates and deflates depending on how high you want your child to sit.  It packs up nice and compact for traveling, although we have never used this traveling since it is our main hi-chair.  Our son likes to lean to the side as far as he can so he cracked one of the buckles, but it still locks and holds him in place :-)",5
"2064","Baby Einstein Around The World Discovery Center","My 8 month old son seems to love this activity center.  When we first got it, he was about 3 months old and he didn\'t do much with it and wasn\'t very stable in it yet.  By about 5-6 months though, he was interacting more with it.  Now he can sit in there for a while (though we just try to keep it to 15 minutes) and enjoys all of the toys.  I think a previous reviewer said that her child was scared of the penguin\'s noise and our son was too at first.  Now he laughs at it though.  Parts of the center were difficult to put together (the piano in particular), but none of the parts are coming off for us no matter how you grab them.  Also, one of the piano buttons is sticking more now so that you sometimes need to lift the button up for it to stop playing.  Things we like about it: you can attach your own toys; the piano has three different modes (colors, animal sounds, music); our son seems to enjoy all of the toys now (the bird in particular for teething on and the little washers in front of the penguin); it\'s easy for him to move himself around from toy to toy;  Negatives: the piano sticking; the difficulty of installing the piano; how hard it is for our son to hit the piano buttons (they aren\'t easy to hit to make the sound come on).  Overall, I would recommend this to others.",4

If you install it properly it should be fine.  If it is not right, I would suggest to go to the police station to see if it is installed properly.

"2070","Britax Chaperone Infant Car Seat, Black","As a first time parents my husband and I knew nothing about infant carriers. After months of research (from day one of finding out we were expecting) we both agreed this was the best choice. The safety features of this infant carrier, to us, out weight the ""inconveniences"" of other\'s complaints. The base installation into our Chevy Equinox and F250 were very easy and with thte base/carrier together they fit just fine. (My husband is 6\'2 and does not have to adjust the passenger seat in my chevy). As far as the complaints about shopping carts and dinning high-chairs, you should never have an infant carrier on the front of a shopping cart (even if it says they are specially made for it, they aren\'t) and restaurants will accomodate space for your carrier/stroller combination so there is no need to ""create a contraption"" to hold the carrier as you eat. So the fact that while in the carrier, on the road, your child is as safe as can be is the only thing that should matter.When the recall notice came out we followed the simple directions and in less than 2 minutes on the phone with customer service our seat was registered and we were informed we purchased before the recall date. The man was very friendly.We registered for the Baby Trend Snap-n-Go stroller to use while our daughter was going to be in the carseat. However because we liked the Britax seat so much we decided to research again the Britax strollers. We decided during the 8th month to return the Snap-n-Go and ordered the Britax B-Agile from Amazon. (Awesome stroller!! Very light weight! I\'m 9mo pregnant and able fold and go with one hand!)We are so happy we made that change. Before the stroller arrived I went to the Britax website to see exactly how the carrier connects to the stroller. I found that if you order them seperately you do need to have the ""click-n-go"" system sent to you. Britax sends it to you for free. Since the stroller had not arrived yet I was worried they could not help me since it was not registered. I called Britax anyway to see if they could get it in the mail as I was afraid it would take a few weeks. I did not have my carrier information with me and she was able to pull everything up by my name from the first time we registered. She double checked all of our information and said they would be in the mail the next day and sure enough 3 days later we had the package. She was really nice and wished us the best of luck with our new addition to the family. Talk about customer service! They are 2 for 2 so far.I put everything together in a matter of minutes and my husband and I are very pleased with it all!! I have been practicing removing the carrier from the base and then from the stroller. It\'s all so simple. I will be having a C-Section in less than 2 weeks and I feel that as soon as I am able to do things for myself, I will be just fine when the hubby is not around.",5

However, the bottles fit just fine on the big prongs and the lower racks provide good drying spots for all of the other parts like the valves, nipples, etc.  I imagine the same would be true for Born Free bottles.  We have the clear colored rack and have not had any of the problems with mold or mildew that other reviewers mentioned.

"2083","Summer Infant Rayshade Stroller Cover","This shade is a great invention!  We have a Baby Trend ExpeditionBaby Trend Americana Jogging Stroller(which we LOVE btw), and even though the canopy is large, it doesn\'t provide enough coverage for our early evening summer walks.  We\'ve been having to rig a muslin blanket into a kind of stroller cocoon but then our son can\'t see the scenery!  I installed this and played around with it a little.  It sticks out further than the Baby Trend canopy.  The 2 middle straps attach it to the back of your stroller, but if you attach these a little bit down on the side of the frame instead, you can stretch the tip of the RayShade out WAY further than your stroller canopy AND see through the viewing window on the top of the canopy.  And your baby is still covered because the canopy covers the area the RayShade doesn\'t!  There\'s also space for your baby to look out the sides!My one complaint is the fabric.  It\'s very soft and floppy.  This CANNOT be used without a stroller canopy underneath to support it.  So if your stroller is missing its canopy, this is not the product for you.  When I received my RayShade, I could see a big snag and hole in the fabric before I even took it out of the package.  I\'m not sure if the velcro on the end of the straps did this or if it happened at the factory.  When I tried to exchange on Amazon, the new one won\'t ship for 1-2 months and I\'d have to send this one back within 30 days, so I guess I\'ll order a new one and then return this one when the new one arrives, just so we\'ll have it to use until then...",4

I read some reviews that the ""batteries burned out quickly"", but ours doesn\'t take batteries.  We really wish it did.

"2087","Thinkbaby BPA Free No Spill Sippy Cup, Orange/Natural, 9 Ounce","I thought these would be the transition bottle/cup: BPA-free, measurement markings on the side, good-looking design. I was so sure, that I bought a couple days\' worth pf bottles after my daughter seemed to like them. But I\'ve grown to hate them. They are so leaky! It\'s easy enough for a baby to unscrew the top and dump the contents unless you twist the top on super-hard \'til you almost can\'t get it off. Then you have the factor that the nipple doesn\'t always make a perfect seal with the ring, so that can cause a leak. This means that the bottles do not travel well&#8212;unless you like having a 30% chance of having to clean up leaks on the go. If there were disks that you could place between the bottle and the ring (like in the Dr. Brown bottles) there would be way less of a travel problem.

At over $20 for two blankets, I rather spend a couple bucks more per blanket for the softer more premium brand like AA, Little Linen Company, Little Giraffe.The print designs on the pink set are more sophisticated than cutesy which I like. Note that the pink color on the two blankets in the set don\'t match. One is pink. The other is a pink that has yellowish tint to it and not a real pink. I don\'t know why they did this. It would be much more visually appealing if the pink dye were the same.

"2102","Baby Trend Chatham Sit N\' Stand Stroller","My wife and I are very happy owners of both the Latch-loc infant carseat and the Snap-n-go stroller base, both from Baby Trend.  For that reason, we were pretty excited when we got a hand-me-down Sit-n-stand LX from a friend.  Our toddler is 22 months and our infant is 4 months, so we could use a double stroller.  However, this thing has problems.  First, when the infant carseat is in its position in the front and nobody\'s on the back, the assembly is very close to falling forward on the infant seat.  The heavy infant seat hangs out farther than the front wheels, so it is (dangerously?) unstable.  Second, the rear seat is rearward-facing, so your young family looks like a two-baby crew team out there, with nobody facing forward.  On the other hand, if the toddler stands and faces forward, he is in the perfect position to throw things at the infant.  Finally, my toddler didn\'t find anything he identified as a seat, and ended up wanting to stand on the back, hold on to the handle, and lean back at a 30 degree angle until his grip almost failed and he suddenly stepped off the back of the moving stroller, or fell on his rear in the road.  A little teaching would probably help that point, but it seems that a seat that isn\'t very good at keeping the toddler in place is certainly not one to depend on to counterbalance the infant seat in front.  Overall, I definitely would not recommend this for anyone with a young infant.",1

"2122","GroVia Organic Cotton Soaker Pad (2 Pack) NATURAL","I have been using cloth diapers with my daughter since she was 6 months old.  She is now 22 months.  I was very hesitant to start on cloth, but I just bought a couple and started trying.  I am so glad I did.  I have spent $650 on my stash for everything I need to use cloth diaper (including the detergent, flushable BioLiners, and re-usable bags to hold the dirty diapers).  I am so very very  happy with Grovia.  And I had an issue with one of these liners and the stitching coming out, so I contacted them and their customer service is EXCELLENT.  I wash every other day at home and always hang dry the inserts (right now when drape them over the radiators to dry faster).One tip:  make SURE to change their diaper as soon as you notice they dirty them.  Otherwise they can get a yeast infection and that happened with me.I LOVE the Grovia diapers.  Here is my synopsis of the Grovia system:- you can reuse the shell.  I love this.- Easy to snap in/out- they take a LONG time to dry.  This means that they can hold a lot of moisture and that is fine with me.  And taking a long time to dry is okay with me because I have at least a days worth more. I hang them outside in the summer and in the winter I hang them over the radiators.- they get stained but who cares, they\'re diapers right?  But the sun bleaches them in the summer and sometimes I very occasionally will put bleach in the wash and that cleans them right up.  (be careful, they don\'t recommend this as the bleach eats up the fabric)- they are expensive, but I think worth it.  They have held up well so far and hopefully will for baby #2.- my daughter has been in the middle size the whole time.  Now she weighs about 24 lbs.  They should definitely last until potty training.I could go on and on about cloth diapers, but I need to stop somewhere.  I hope this helps those of you looking to use them!",5
"2123","green sprouts 10 Pack Waterproof Absorbent Terry Bibs, Girls","These bibs are the best I\'ve tried so far (out of about 6 different brands). I have purchased at least 3 sets of 10, in both the boy and girl colors.Pros:-beautiful, color-fast colors-big variety of colors in one 10-pack. I can always find a bib to match whatever outfit he is wearing.-absent of cutesy distracting baby designs and obnoxious patterns. My 16-month old has been wearing bibs all day every day for a year, and I very quickly got tired of seeing bibs with ""MONKEY BOY"" or ""POWER DROOLER"" all over them. They are a part of his wardrobe, and I want them to be as inconspicuous as possible.-soft-absorbent-truly water resistant: there is a waterproof layer sandwiched between the two layers of terry cloth-strong velcro-both the fabric AND the velcro stay perfectly flat after repeated washings, rather than buckling or curling from the dryer like many others I have gone through-the strong velcro STAYS strong after repeated washings, not getting weaker or with repeated use or exposure to the dryer (also like many others I have gone through)-perfect size...not too big, not too small-really decent price for a pack of 10 in my opinionConsiderations:-You must make sure that the velcro is closed (scratchy velcro half fastened to the soft half of the velcro) when you wash them with other delicate fabrics, like a satin-feel baby blanket, or the very strong velcro will catch those delicate materials. To me, this is a common-sense laundering issue, not a product flaw, hence my rating of 5 stars. You also have to make sure the velcro is fastened well (that the two pieces match up, no overlapping, etc.) when you put it on your baby. Since the velcro is very strong (and scratchy when opened), it can irritate sensitive baby skin. Again, a common sense issue, since all you have to do is make sure the two velcro halves match up when you fasten the bib, then no scratchy parts are exposed to skin. Again, common sense and in my opinion not a product flaw.Edit on 3/27/2013:  I am now using the very same bibs on my 18 month old daughter.  So these bibs have been in constant use since November of 2009, well over 3 years, and still look great...colors are still bright, terrycloth hasn\'t pilled, waterproof layer between the terry layers is still fully intact, and they come out of the dryer essentially flat (not curled from the low heat).  Velcro still super sticky.  I haven\'t had to throw a SINGLE ONE out...really amazing.  I\'m pleasantly shocked at how well they\'ve held up!",5

After battling meds, breastfeeding, hypoallergenic formulas and hours of crying these past months, the GI doctor and I really felt like the reflux wasn\'t the problem- it was all GAS due to a problem with his sucking-swallowing reflex.  So today I ran to the store to get this to give it a try after reading the reviews.  I did it just like I was suppose to and nothing the first couple of tries.  I was so upset and so was he.  I knew he needed relief... so after ten minutes I decided I would give it another go.  Did all the massaging (we already do that) and tried again... whistle, whistle, toot, toot and a little poop!  He laughed!  He was so happy!  I tried a couple more times and definitely was able to release some gas! I did have to move it around a tiny bit.  I didn\'t want to irritate anything so I was really careful, but that\'s when the gas came out.  I proceeded to put him down to bed right after since it was bed time and no intense screaming and he went right down!!  Normally I have to bounce him for at least an hour- two minutes of bouncing!  I can already tell this may not work every time, but I bet it works more times than none if you keep trying.  I would be careful if your baby has any kind of full tummy though as I can see how this could get very, very messy!!I bought this at buy buy baby so I could get it faster and used a 20% off coupon... well worth the money.

"2139","Kolcraft Simple Shut Safety Gate - White","We have two of these gates in our house.  I installed both of them.  The gates, when installed properly work very well, and are very strong.Our son has been crawling and pulling himself up for a few months now, and he is finally starting to really cruse around the room.  These gates do a good job of keeping him from going up the stairs, and from falling down to the next level of the house.  At this point he climbs up on the gate, and bounces and shakes it... its not going to open little boy!The gate installs pretty easily.  You will need SOME form of mechanical aptitude to assemble and install them properly.  The gates come with hardware for mounting into a solid door frame, NOT DRYWALL!  I would never install a hardware mounted gate into bare drywall, it simply will not be strong enough.If you do plan to use this with drywall, add a 1"" wide by 1/2"" deep furring strip so the gate has a good solid wood surface to mount to.The instructions are clear, it comes with cut-out templates that can be taped to the wall, so drilling holes is a no-brainier.  It works well in our old house with crooked walls.All you really need to install this is a good cordless drill (or screwdriver) and about 30 min, and a Phillips head screwdriver.  I do not recommend your 9 month old ""helps"" you at all.The gate opens well, and with out much difficulty.  One key selling point for us us the fact that this gate does not have a ""base/trip bar"" that most other gates have.  We don\'t want grandma and grandpa (or us!) falling as we carry the baby over the threshold of the gate.The gate swings a full 90 degrees in BOTH directions, which is great!To open the gate, you must swing a spring loaded latch out of the way, and then lift the gate about 1/2"" of an inch.Yes, there is a metal ""bar"" that is what engages the latch, but I picture it hard for a child to run, full speed and hurt themselves with this gate..  And, if your SMART, you can adjust the gate to the point where this metal bar only ""sticks out"" about 1/2""... hardly ""eye gouging""..  The directions point this fact out!  RTFM people!!!!The gate also does a fantastic job at keeping our dog in check in her space when we are gone out of the house.The gates clean finish, and ease of use, and good quality construction make this a solid buy for us.  I prefer it over the other brand gate we have (KidCo).. these gates are easier to use, were cheaper, and have a better finished ""look"" to them - they are also easier to open.  It opens one handed, while holding the baby (me and my wife can do it!  so can you!).-Dan",5

We started with Charlie Banana, moved to GDiapers, then Rumparooz (insert-styled), then prefolds (osocozy, dandelion & gerber), now to the original flats. Flat diapers take longer, but don\'t give my 4mo\' old the butt of a 3yr old because they\'re so trim and neat. One thing they don\'t do is focus on his wetting toward the front, and I WAS using my old C.B. inserts under his flat-fold diaper until I bought a pair of these.-- SUPER absorbent (don\'t even NEED to be folded, but I just do it over night) and super thin/flat, so his diapers remain very trim and not even a little bulky. At night I fold one in half and put it in the front and the flat diaper isn\'t even wet in the morning, because of how much these drew in.This is coming from my BB peeing so much at night through 2 C.B. inserts, an osocozy prefold and a diaper cover that his clothes would be soaked in pee all the way up to his chest.I\'m buying another pack of 2 right now, and the 4 we have will be saving us from midnight clothes changes.

It\'s a safe place to put him when I make his bottle. I like being able to pop him onto the swing when we come home from a car ride because he is sleeping.The swing takes 4 C batteries -- so far I\'ve used it for about a month and haven\'t needed more batteries.The vibration and sound features take 2 AA batteries.PROs-Small, lightweight, compact.-Less expensive-Vibration soothes babyCONs-The swing speed control is a dial. Off/slow/fast. Because the weight of your baby effects the motion (as it would in any swing) I have to turn up the dial 3 times to get a short swing (for my newborn) and there\'s not much more dial to go for ""full speed."" It makes me wonder how long (up to what baby weight) it will still work.-The swing mechanism makes a pretty loud clicking noise, typical of swings but it may annoy you and there are quieter swings available-No AC plug in-Controls in awkward spot-Sound feature is limited just on/offNone of these cons are a big deal to me, however, if you want a swing with more features that also holds a Graco car seat try:Graco Sweet Peace Soother Swing, Cuddly Bearthough this one is almost 3x as expensive.Parent tip: If you want your baby to fall asleep in the swing try to only put them in it when they\'re calm so they think of it as a restful place.",5

"2143","Woombie Wrap &amp; Snap - Little Pond-Big Baby","This product was recommended to me by a good friend who claimed she had a total Houdini who\'d get her arms out constantly. Sounded like my son, so I thought I\'d give it a go.I find the wrap awkward; the velcro wrap part has to wrap all the way around his torso multiple times, so you end up having to sit baby up, fight with the wrap to get it nice and smooth and flat in the back, wrap it around the front, around his back again (sitting him up to do it), etc. I find it too awkward to do with a kid who\'s losing it, all the while trying to keep his arms by his sides. And, despite all of the hard work, he *still* manages to get his hands up and out, no matter how tightly you wrap him.The Wombie/sac portion is nice - it has a 2-way zipper that you can open from the top or the bottom of the wrap, which is really handy.If you have a \'strong spirited\' or bruiser baby like mine, who is truly an absolute Houdini at getting their hands/arms free, I wouldn\'t recommend this product.

"2144","Graco Twin IPO Stroller, Navarro","I really like this stroller, I have 2 little girls-3yrs.and 14 months. We are going to Dollywood soon, and after a trip to the zoo last summer pushing 2 strollers that weren\'t comfortable for the girls, I knew I had to do something. I researched strollers for hours, and the conclusion I came to was that no stroller is perfect, especially double strollers. I did get this about 16 dollars cheaper on Overstock, sorry Amazon. It does need cupholders, but that can be fixed. It doesn\'t have a lot of storage, although the baskets would be good for diapers, wipes, sunscreen, etc. The problem with the baskets are they are hard to access, and impossible when the seats are reclined, but I can deal with that. It also needs bigger sun shades, although I am thinking of trying to make my own, since spending 55.00 on one kind of defeats the purpose of shopping around for the lowest price. When I got the stroller, I noticed the back right wheel was bent. It still works, but I didn\'t want to trust it in the middle of an amusement park. I emailed Graco over the weekend, and Monday morning they responded and told me they were sending me a new wheel. With my girls in it, the whole thing weighs about 95 lbs, but you would never know it.It pushes easily and smoothly even with a bent wheel. My 3yo is 39 in and about 32 lbs, and she fits just fine. If she slides down just a little, she can lay down comfortably. This is a great stroller, and I am looking forward to walking more. Even my 14 mo loves riding in it. It is a little heavy, but it isn\'t meant to be carried, it is meant to be pushed. It fits with room to spare in my Ford Focus trunk.I highly recommend it! Hope this helps.",5

"2148","TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","But they were just so thick that I couldn\'t wear them during the day, and they are so small, diameter-wise, that they really weren\'t good at night with all the shifting while you sleep.

I love Ju Ju Be\'s other products, but this was a miss.",2

"2153","Lamaze Stack, Roll and Crawl Ball","There is nothing special about this toy. My daughter is simply not interested in it. The ball, looks like a ball but does not really function as a ball as it easily splits up into its components when rolled around.

"2157","Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More","My newborn loves this pillow, he sleeps for hours.  My baby loves it more than being swaddled.  Because the hole is to big for my 7lb baby I place three small blankets in the middle of the pillow to fill some of the hole, it works great.  I can pick him up and move him from room to room without waking him.  My favorite part is the velcro attachment to secure my little one from slipping down the pillow.  It\'s a total score that you can use it for nursing too. I am beyond thankful that I purchased this.  I am going to buy all my girlfriends one for their baby showers. It\'s a life saver!!!",5

"2162","Totshield Stove Guard for Stoves with Control Knobs Located in the Back (Usually Electric Stoves)","The guard is held together with plastic screws that can easily be loosened by my 15 month old twins, but this isn\'t the biggest problem.The plastic guard blocks the vents of the oven. So if I am baking something hot condensation forms against the plastic and drips.My oven door stays cool even when the oven is on, so it is normally safe for the kids to be in the kitchen. The condensation problem this guard creates, makes it unsafe for my kids or even me to be around it.",1

"2166","Dream On Me / Mia Moda Compagno Stroller, Mint Java","Yes this stroller is heavy, a little heavier than the Graco Duo Glide double that I had. I love the way it handles, maneuvers very well. I dislike that my diaper bag will not fit in the storage basket. I also dislike the way you access the storage basket,but I guess that is how all sit in stands are. This stroller is not compact when folded lucky for me I have a huge SUV the down side is getting it in because of its weight, but hey won\'t hurt to build a little more muscle. Overall I am pleased with this stroller and my 2 1/2 yr old loves it too. He says he likes his new stroller.",4

I only wish that I had this same sleeper for my other two kids.",5

I didn\'t find this to be very secure, although the cover itself was attractive, and made of 100% cotton. The cover is very stiff out of the box, and I intend to wash it a few times to see if it will soften up. I\'ll update the review at that point.",3

"2175","Combi Cabria Stroller, Manhattan","I was looking for a lightweight stroller that was stylish, had the features I wanted, affordable and can work as a travel system. I didn\'t find it any store in the Houston area to try it in person, so I went ahead and purchased the royal blue stroller and the matching Combi shuttle car seat  from online based on the reviews.Pros: very light weight at 15lbs, beautiful color, huge multi position adjustable canopy, 5 point harness, has a snack tray with a cup holder that can be detached completely, parent storage and cup holder, soft seat cushion in a breathable material that\'s machine washable, infinite seat recline from fully upright to flat for napping, removable panel can attach to the grab bar/snack tray to act as a basinett for infants, Combi Shuttle car seat adapter is included.Cons: hard to manuver, foot brakes are difficult to operate..I had to use my hands, the wheels are plastic and felt flimsy, the entire stroller didn\'t feel sturdy, storage basket is not only small but difficult to access due to a metal bar running accorss the middle of it, the color of the stroller did not match the car seat even though they were both royal blue, both front wheels have to be locked before folding the stroller otherwise it won\'t stay upright.I ended up returning the system because the foot brake, storage basket and the overall feel of the stroller was a deal breaker for me. Basically, you get what you pay for. If someone is willing to overlook the cons mentioned above, it\'s a good value for the price.",3
"2176","Twinkle Twinkle Little Star Bibs, 5 Pack, Girl, Frenchie Mini Couture","When my girl was younger (less than 6 months) I preferred the Gerber bibs from Target because I thought they were adorable and these were a bit large (correct in the neck hole, but a bit long and wide), but now that she\'s bigger (12 months) the gerber bibs are too short, while these are still going strong.  It\'s true that two are blank, three have writing.  Velcro is still good after countless washings.  Terry front, plastic back.",5

You have to rub rather hard and for a long time for the film to come away from the protective cover. Took me at least 10 minute per cloud. Don\'t place in reach of animals or children as it won\'t take much for them to be scratched and wrinkle up. Will not buy again.",2
"2179","ERGObaby Four Position 360 Baby Carrier, Grey","Of the three carriers we\'ve tried with our little one, this is by far the favorite. It\'s soft, padded, supportive, and well designed and built. It\'s also the most pricey carrier I\'ve tried, but I certainly appreciate the thought that went into designing this, and making it as ergonomic as possible for both the parent (I almost typed mom, but I\'m the dad, and use it just as much as she does) and the child.The variety of carrying positions are nice. I haven\'t used the original ergobaby carrier for comparison, but this one certainly offers more options than either of the other two carriers we\'ve tried, and is even suitable for extended trips and hikes.It\'s a keeper.",5
"2180","Prince Lionheart Compact Seatsaver","Must have buy for parents with car seats.  When my son was first born, I didn\'t know anything about seat savers and I had his car seat directly on my seats.  When I pulled everything out to clean in a few months, I noticed deep lines in the seats where the leather was stretched.  I immediately bought this seatsaver and I am happy with my purchase.  I think it might actually save my seats when/if I ever get these car seats out of my car! I have one now for my son\'s booster seat and my daughters car seat.",5
"2181","Growing Up Green Wood Step Stool, Natural","This stool is very sturdy, it fits most of the uses needed for a household stool. My 3 year old grandson can carry it around, and use it for turning on lights, or reaching objects. It\'s very well made, and looks like a nice piece of furniture. The crevasses are a little difficult to clean, but that is not a major concern, since all the pluses outweight the negative of the crevasses.",5
"2182","Neat Solutions 8 Pack Multi-Color Solid Knit Terry Feeder Bib, Girl","These bibs give good coverage, and I love that they come in so many different colors and a plain so that they can easily match any outfit.

"2183","Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat","I used this chair from the time my daughter came home from the hospital until she was about 6 months old & she LOVED it! My husband & i RAVE about this little chair to everyone we know who is having a baby! The little bunny was my daughters 1st \'friend\' (we actually gave it the nickname bunny-friend!) The ONLY negative about this chair is the vibration timer, but like one of the other reviews said, we totally understand about the time limit for baby & also battery life! My daughter is now 3 & i just took this chair out of storage for our new baby...threw the cushion in the washing machine & it is like new! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!",5

"2188","Kolcraft Universal Infant Car Seat Carrier","Item not as lightweight and compact as I had hoped it would be.  It is universal so I can\'t expect the car seat to be a perfect fit, but I wish the car seat fit more securely.  Serves its purpose though.  Not nearly as bulky and heavy as my Graco Travel System.  Very easy to push and maneuvers well.  Easy one-hand fold up system.",NA
"2189","Chewbeads Greenwich Necklace","I\'m a big fan of the Chewbeads products, and this one does not disappoint!  It is safe for my little guy to chew on and yet still stylish enough for me to wear out of the house.  Win-win!  It is easy to clean--just a little soap and water.  I also like that is has a breakaway clasp in the back.  We have already used that feature with my son pulling the necklace a little too hard.",NA

"2191","Stokke Tripp Trapp Highchair Anniversary Edition (Natural)","Our grandson is only 15 months old but much taller and heavier than the average toddler that age.  He was fast approaching the weight limit of his regular high-chair, yet he still needed some of the restraint and safety that a high-chair provides.  I learned about this product from a Danish friend who ordered 2 of them for her grandchildren.  They are very practical in terms of growing with the child, allowing the child to sit at the table with the rest of the family, and giving the child gradual independence by allowing him to climb into the chair himself. He really loves it as do his parents.  It looks like a piece of furniture and blends well into the dining room.  This is one of the smartest ""baby"" purchases we have made.  It\'s very high quality construction, well designed and thought-out for the child\'s different stages of development.",NA
"2192","Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","After reading reviews for dozens of baby gates, I decided to go with this one. I just received it today, four days earlier than the delivery date said, and installed it by myself in about 15 minutes(I didn\'t use the wall cups). My door frame is about 31"" wide and it fits perfectly. I usually use a short, standard plastic or wood gate and it was difficult for my grandparents to hurdle trying to get into my kitchen or bathroom so I really love the door. So far I haven\'t had any problems getting the latch open and am able to open it with one hand. Also, my two year old daughter needed a way to get to the bathroom on her own without relying on someone to pick her up over the gate and with this one I can leave the latch up so the door won\'t lock, but when I want to keep her out of the kitchen/bathroom area, I can lock it.  Its just what I was looking for!",5
"2193","VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Video Camera","We liked this product until after 7 months, the picture on the monitor would go black or green lines and the sound would go out.  As far as we can tell, it is the camera side that is bad, not the parent unit.  It was a gift and so we don\'t have a receipt.  We are wondering if purchasing another camera is our best option?",3
"2194","Gerber Plastic Pants, 18 Months, Fits 24-28 lbs. (4 pairs)","I am not sure how to say it, but we needed plastic pants and they worked.  Just make sure all of the cotton training pants or diapers are tucked inside or you will need to change clothes along with training pants or diapers.  They do make a very distinctive sound my daughter is not fond of, but they did the job.",5
"2195","Imse Vimse Soft Diaper Covers - Hoop and Loop - Newborn - White","My 14 month old has been cloth diapered from birth. We have 3 of these covers, and I would not buy them again. There are other covers on the market priced lower that work better.Specifically, the way the velcro on this diaper is arranged is problematic. The tabs tend to roll, and then scratch baby\'s thighs or tummy. The fit of this cover was very good for my daughter, and we never had leaks with this cover. But the velcro scratching is no fun for little ones.",3

"2198","2-in-1 Car Seat Cover `n Carry","I have used this bag a few times and it works well in some ways. My Britax Roundabout fits spaciously (as long as it is positioned backwards), and the wheels on the bottom are genius. One major flaw is that the clips that attach the backpack straps to the bag are positioned so they dig into your shoulders when you wear the seat on your back. It is extremely painful, so I have not been able to continue using it as a backpack. I\'m now looking for some terry cloth arm bands people wear on their wrists for tennis, and I\'m going to try to use those to cover the clips. If I could, I would return this bag for something more comfortable. In the meantime, we attach it to a rolling suitcase and pull it on its wheels, which works sufficiently well, although it is a bit awkward and tippy. I have not (yet) had the fabric tearing problem that the majority of other reviewers complain about. Maybe I just got lucky with gentle airline handlers.",2

I did it by myself because I didn\'t want to wait for my husband to get home.  I think it is super versatile and use it daily for walking.  I like that you don\'t need a bar to use and infant seat.  You just swing down the tray and it hooks my graco infant seat perfectly.  I also think the back seat is super convenient.  I can take it off or put it on easily.  The only think I don\'t like is that when you fold it up you have to make sure the wheels are a certain way or it won\'t fold nd you need to take off the front shade for it to fold as well.  Oh well...... no stroller will have everything.... besides if there was a perfect stroller this stroller would have jogger wheels making it THE PERFECT STROLLER!!!!!!!!!!!!",4
"2217","myBaby Soundspa Lullaby Sound Machine and Projector","We love this machine. We use it all the time - naps (sound) and nighttime (both sound & projection). This little machine is one of our favorite things! :) It is nice and small (softball sized) so it doesn\'t take up much room and therefore can also travel. Ours goes with my daughter on overnights and has been on three out of state airplane trips. It\'s nice to take this little piece of home with us  and drown out the sounds of a new place. We\'ve had it for a little over a year, and the motor just quit making the projector spin, but it has also taken a beating. I just ordered a new one, so it will stay at home and the old one will travel. :) I have a 2 month old and one that just turned two, and they both love it!!!",5
"2218","Cloud b Sleep Sheep On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds","This is a great portable sound machine.  Buy the smaller one (the larger one is way too large).  The velcro straps lets you hook it onto virtually anything.  The sound quality is pretty good and loud (we mostly did the waves).  My main complaint is that it shuts off too soon (43 min. is the longest).  As soon as it shut off my daughter would wake up so we actually had to invest in a plug in sound machine that played cont. (rec. the marpac but if you don\'t want to spend that much then go with the graco).  This works for travel and in the stroller or carseat.",4
"2219","Superyard Colorplay Ultimate Playard","I went with this gate for the price mostly.  It is one of the cheapest I could find on amazon.  I kind of wish I had shelled out a little bit more money though.  It\'s not so bad, but the door can be very tricky to open/close.  After some practice, I don\'t have much of a problem, but my husband doesn\'t like it!!!I found a few pieces of sharp plastic that had broken off when I was unfolding it as well.  The panels didn\'t adjust all that easily, and the joints is where the plastic broke off.  It still works fine and didn\'t affect it\'s function, but finding shape plastic on the floor that broke off is obviously worrisome.  We haven\'t moved the panels or anything since we initially set it up.  It\'s doing it\'s job, and I\'m not going to be replacing it, but I would have gone with more expensive metal one if I could do it again.  Would have been worth the extra 40 dollars!",3
"2220","My Cloth Baby Eco Grow One (One Size Cloth Diaper) 2 Pk with Wetbag","I\'ve been using cloth diapers for about 2 years now. I\'ve tried most of the brands out there--big, national brands and WAHMs. These diapers are a GREAT price for OS diapers, and they\'re really cute. I\'ve never had a leak when using My Cloth Baby diapers, and they fit my son really well. They are great diapers, all around, especially when you consider the awesome price!!The wetbag. Where to start with my love for these wetbags??? I should first mention that I\'m sort of addicted to wetbags, and we have, easily 12. LOL I\'ve tried many of these as well. This is, hands down, my favorite wetbag ever. I plan to sell the others I have to buy more of these! The size is perfect, it holds several diapers without being too large and bulky. The prints are beyond adorable, and cuter in person than in pictures. They zip shut, which is great for keeping everything where you want it. Finally, it has 2 pockets, so you can keep clean diapers in one and the dirties in another, or use the front pocket to keep wipes in.You can\'t go wrong with this set. Both the diapers and the wetbag are excellent, and the price is a great deal!",5
"2221","Yookidoo Crawl N\' Go Snail","My 6 month old loves this toy!  The stacker is wonderful with all of the shapes and colors!  The little squeaker toy is really fun to play with, too.

So much of electricity is wasted by keeping it on all day long. So, I bought one of those electrical outlet timers that turn on/off at set times in a day.  The upstairs warmer is off all day and turns on at 9 PM until 9 AM.

I was a little concerned because a few reviews mentioned it was smelly, but I figured I would just open it up and air it out before our baby arrived. It was super stinky when I first opened it - it smelled like chemicals and plastic - so we put it in a room with the window open and closed the door to the rest of the house. I won\'t lie - the smell was awful to me, but I was pregnant at the time and had a nose like a blood hound - my husband didn\'t think it smelled that bad, and my mother said she could barely smell it all. After a couple of weeks the smell mellowed out a lot, to the point that no one could smell it except me when I squished the pad. I ended up sprinkling a bit of baby powder on it before I put the changing pad cover on, and then it was fine.We love it now and have been using it for the last 6 months. It is contoured so my super wiggly little girl still can\'t manage to roll off, and it has survived several accidents - I just wipe it clean and off we go.TL:DR - Great changing pad, but buy it and air it out for a couple of months before baby arrives!",4
"2244","VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units","I loved this audio monitor for 9 months. It was easy to set up, easy to use, worked great and the 2 parent units were awesome. Why don\'t more baby monitors come with 2 parent units?Well, today, I accidentally kicked the power strip while sorting stuff in the baby\'s room and powered off the baby unit. When I powered it back on, the parent units wouldn\'t connect with the baby units. I tried everything in the manual and on their trouble shooting website, and then I came here to see if anyone else had had this problem. And what do you know... LOTS of people have had this problem.So it\'s a known issue and the manufacturer\'s solution is to send you a replacement. So let me see if I understand this situation: every time I power off the baby unit, the audio monitor will cease to function I have to then call in and get a replacement? That\'s ridiculous. We\'re about to move and I don\'t have time to deal with getting the audio monitor replaced knowing that in a month when we move and have to unplug it, I have to call again to get it replaced. I will be returning this unit and shopping for another product.I should probably note that we did unplug it 2-3 times before this happened, so it doesn\'t happen right away. Looking at other reviews, it seems to happen if you unplug it after about 6 months of use.",1

"2248","Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot","After ordering and evaluating 5 different bags, this is the one!  I have 2 school-age kids with lots of activities to keep up with, a 4 year old and a new baby.  I wanted to find a diaper bag that looked a little more classy and purse-like, and held plenty of gear in an organized manner, as well as holding a few items for myself so I can ditch the additional purse.  The fabric on this bag is beautiful.  I was afraid it would be very light and therefore show dirt easily, but it is darker than it appears on the website, but still very attractive.  There is faux-leather reinforcement on the bottom, along with metal feet.  I first ordered this bag in indigo dot and was really turned off by the blue faux-leather straps and trim, they just looked so cheap and plastic-like.  I saw the bag in black dot in a store and it was no better.  However, in pewter dot, the same straps and trim in the metallic grey color don\'t look bad at all!  As other reviewers have said repeatedly, the bag has lots of good-sized and useful pockets, including 6 open pockets and one zippered pocket inside the main compartment and two large bottle pockets, two zippered pockets on the front and one open/magnetic pocket and a medium sized zippered antimicrobial pocket on the back.  I was able to put all my diaper bag necessities including an aden and anais swaddle blanket and baby k\'tan wrap, my wallet and several essentials from my purse into the bag in a way that I can find anything quickly, and there is still plenty of room for extra items if needed.Addendum:  one month laterI am still loving the bag and have had several compliments on it.  My only complaint is that the stroller strap clips are very difficult to use - they are small and have to be opened wide to get the clip open, which is hard to do with one hand while holding the bag up under the stroller with the other hand!  Then, since the stroller straps are short, if I need to get anything out of the bag I have to unclip and then reattach it to the stroller, a tedious process.  This would be the one area in which I\'d suggest improvement to this bag.",5

The fold is easy, the unfold is easier, and pushing is easiest of all. I love that it has a folded stand, its such an understated luxury! The canopy is huge, the seat is cushy, the footrest folds up so its straight which is great for sleeping babes. The basket is a good size too. And its lightweight. The recline is super flat and it can sit more upright than any other stroller Ive had.The only difference between this one and the newer one seems to be a movable handlebar, which might come in handy to the tall, but for me at 5\'5&#34; the height is perfect.The sapphire color is a tan/gray. Its not as gray as the picture, but its not as tan as some google images would show you either. Its pretty though.I would absolutely recommend this stroller to anyone looking for one, you cant beat the price and the strollers in the same price range cant compete.Cons, none really.  In general I wish there were more color options, but there aren\'t any faults with the stroller!",5

"2266","Medela Nursing Stool","I registered for this stool when pregnant, thinking it would be a nice position-helper while breast feeding, and it is, with one drawback: it tips easily if you put any weight on the edges (top edge or either side). So far, this hasn\'t been a huge problem, except for making a loud THUMP every time I do it, which sometimes startles the baby. I would just suggest that you avoid ever using it as an actual stool and never step or stand on it, and keep any little kiddos away from it too.Other than the potentially dangerous tipping thing, it is a nice wood piece and went together very easily. As stated before, I would not use it in place of a safer flat stool, but it would be absolutely great under a desk to prop up your feet while working.",3

It\'s one of the best things we\'ve gotten for our family to become mobile on our bikes. I wanted to go out with my daughter on my bike but saw that most baby bike seats had an age limit that would mean soon we\'d have to transition to something else soon as she grew. I needed something that would last until she could start using her own bicycle with training wheels at least. I\'ve even let my 5 year old go for a ride with me so she could feel what it was like. But with her it was (a little) difficult because she\'s so much bigger to fit between my legs, but it was totally doable. My two year old fits perfectly and it\'s not uncomfortable at all that she is there. She loves it and is very comfortable. The foot rest has never moved or slipped for me.I have loved having the Tyke Toter. It has freed us to go biking all around our neighborhood and further afield too. I feel safe that my daughter is between my arms where I can see her at all times. People often comment on the cuteness factor and ask where they can get it.",5

We never experienced leaking during the actual feedings.I especially liked the wideness of the nipples and the bottle.  My daughter learned how to hold the bottle by herself when she was only 3 months old!  I think alot of it had to do with the fact that the bottles are wide enough for her little hands to get ahold of.  I also like the fact that these bottles can be used as sippy cups by simply changing out the top. Save cabinet space by not having tons of bottles and cups and also saves $.",5

I find this odd since most doorways in America are 36""  I got it to fit the 36"" doorway by installing it without the extension, but there are gaping gaps on either side and it\'s supported by 4 screws that are overextended to make up for the slack.  I think this is a terrible design.  I\'m not happy with it, but it\'ll do until I find a permanent solution.",2
"2298","Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","The widest opening in the gate is nearly 3 inches.  I have a small yorkie-poo and he fits right through it.  I kept it because it is really sturdy, I like the way it opens on the top and it will stay open on its own if you do not shut it.  It works perfectly on the stairs in our home (on the first step) to deter the dogs from going upstairs (even if the one can fit though).  We leave it open at times when we want the dogs to be able to go up and down on their own.",4
"2299","Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib","These are the best bibs that I have found.  Specifically I have had issues with the velcro on other bibs that has become too worn to stick anymore.  The velcro on these is quite tough and hasn\'t been an issue yet.  As the description states, they are waterproof and a quick rinse after meals and they are dry and set to go for the next meal.  They also make versions that have full sleeves and half sleeves....great product!",5

My daughter loves it, the music/mobile goes just long enough for her to go to sleep and not drive me crazy, it has both battery and wall plug capability, and it has no problem swinging my daughter now that she\'s over 15 lbs. like a lot of other swings do. Definitely worth the money!",NA
"2305","South Shore Peak-a-Boo Collection Changing Table, White","Excellent!",5
"2306","Fisher-Price Sounds \'n Lights Monitor with Dual Receiver","I purchased this product after having been happy with the older model for my first baby four years ago.  The changes they made to the design are horrible!  The product is cheap and so light-weight that the receivers fall over very easily (the old style was much more solid and didn\'t tip).  The on/off button on the transmitter is so small you can barely get your finger on it - when you do manage to press the on/off button, the transmitter falls over because of the same cheap, light-weight design.  The antenna on the old style flipped down nicely to make packing easy - the new model requires you to unscrew it, which leaves it loose in your bag!  The volume control on the transmitters have no numbering system, so unless the baby is making noise you can\'t tell if you have it on loud enough - or if it\'s too loud; the old style granted us numbers on the volume control. And it picks up more radio waves than the old design.Why this company would make so many changes to make it into a flimsy piece of junk is beyond me...especially when they had a previous design that worked!Don\'t buy!!!",1
"2307","Cariboo Folding Bassinet - Espresso","I bought this instead of getting a travel crib to transport our newborn from our bedroom to the grandparents\' and even to our vacation home- it\'s perfect!

The remote control is great but it willnot activate the mobile unless I am standing in the door of the nursery. I wish it had a longer range OR that you had the option to keep the mobile playing until you turned it off. Sometimes it will go off before the baby goes to sleep.",4
"2313","Safety First Secure Lights Audio Monitor","After reading about the amount of radiation i was bombarding my children with by having WiFi monitors broadcasting, I decided to switch to old school analog. These are super basic and obviously I miss many of the more advanced functions of my video monitors. These are quirky and I have found that other devices in my house can cause static and even other things that are plugged in across the room. For example, if I unplug the apple charger across the room, it actually adds static. So after some experimenting i have landed in a good place where i don\'t have much static at all and can hear the children at night. The static is not a concern during the day since overall daytime ambiance is louder, therefore it can be plugged in or on batteries anywhere. The range is great. I live in the city, so there is no escaping wifi, nor do i want to as I love technology. I don\'t however need it broadcasting feet from my developing babies. if you are so inclined to look into the topic, google wiredchild website. Cheers!",4

"2317","Philips AVENT BPA Free Single Electric Breast Pump","I have always used Avent products and have been pleased with them. Nevertheless having used the electric breastpump for a couple of times I am utterly disappointed. I got the electric one to save time and be able to pump my milk faster, but the more speed you use, the more milk collects in the diaphragm, instead of dripping into the bottle. It\'s terribly frustrating to see you milk being wasted and in the end it turns out better to use the manual one.Having used Medela breastpumps before, I highly recommend that brand. Do not buy the Avent one, at least not the single-electric one!",NA
"2318","Zoli Baby Breath Electric Nasal Aspirator","After buying the gerber nasal aspirated, this one hits the number one list. Most nasal aspirators do NOT come apart for cleaning. This one is a pricer, but worth it!! I use it every day, about twice a day (morning and eve).  I love to keep my son\'s nasal passages clean and clear so that he can breathe better. He doesn\'t mind because it\'s not so intrusive and a breeze to use. I LOVE the fact that it all comes apart for cleaning!! that is a plus and a bonus! If you care about your babies hygiene, you must purchase this product!",5
"2319","Fisher-Price Baby Papasan","We purchased this while expecting, and were very glad we had it when our baby was a newborn.  He refused to sleep in his crib, either because it was big and scary, or because he couldn\'t comfortably lay flat.  He slept easily and soundly in the papasan, and we could fit the whole papasan in the crib to get him used to it.Pros:1. Comfy and holds baby at a good angle.2. No bright colors or distracting toys.3. Can be used from 7-15 pounds, at least.4. Vibrate setting is just right, and not annoyingly loud.5. Music is also not annoying.6. Cover removes easily for cleaning.Cons (and the reason I only gave this 4 stars):1. Batteries are hard to change, and the battery cover could easily have been designed differently.2. A steeper angle and a shallower angle would have been nice.This saved us from having to try to get a bassinet as well as a baby seat, and meant that baby could sleep wherever we were.",4
"2320","Safety 1st Swing Shut Toilet Lock","We got two of these--one for each bathroom. While putting them on was a little tricky, there\'s a pretty good margin of error so it worked fine. And once installed, they work very well. The problem was that both eventually loosened and then came undone, which makes them useless. This happened as a result of regular use--nothing exceptional at all. And tightening them is not possible as a result of how they\'re designed. You\'d have to take the whole thing off and then remove the sticky pad on the bottom in order to tighten the screws. That may not sound so bad, but this thing is really hard to take off, particularly if you don\'t want to damage the toilet seat. And when you do get it off--after a lot of Goo Gone and scraping and peeling--the sticky pad will be useless. Having been through all of that, I\'d definitely try other options before ever considering going back to this one. It\'s just too much of a hassle.",NA
"2321","South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","After reading several reviews I was worried about what to expect after ordering. I guess some people don\'t understand how to read directions or expect expensive fancy wood for the low price? After the changing table was put together, it was sturdy and looked just like the picture and the color was pure white. I had no damaged pieces and the table was very sturdy for a baby to be changed on top, I have a 4 year old son and there is no way the changing table can be tipped over by him. My husband also said it came with parts to attach the table to the wall, which we did not use. I did have to help my husband with directions, but if each picture is looked at closely, all parts were found easily for us. It took about 3 hours to put together with breaks. I did not like that the inside drawer sliding hardware was plastic at first, but when the drawers were put in and slid in and out with ease and quietness, I was pleased. I think if you\'re on a budget and looking for the best table for your money, this is the one to buy. The cottage look would be very expensive in a furniture store for sure.",5
"2322","Koala Baby Luxe Baby Blanket in Pink","My 18 month old loves this blanket so much I just ordered another one. I bought it for her last spring, and she asks for it every night. It is the softest blanket I\'ve found; my preschooler wants one, too. I wish I could find a grown-up sized one for myself. I got one for my newborn niece, and my sister is also ordering a second one to have on hand. Other reviewers have written that it frays and that the satin separates, but I can tell you that weekly washings since April have not caused a bit of fraying or separating.",5

The sound is loud enough for regular use in baby\'s crib when home, but the smaller size makes it easy to take along in the stroller or when going out of town.  I find the best sound to be ""ocean,"" which is white noise.",5
"2328","Big Taggie Blanket - Puppytime 18x18","I bought this blanket for my 7 month-old son to watch his Baby Einstein DVD\'s with.  One night he was feeling really bad and after giving him a dose of baby Tylenol, we snuggled with him and this Taggie blanket.  He was really comforted and the tags (and DVD) were a great distraction for him until the medicine began to work.  Washes up nicely, too.  Thick and fleecy material that is stitched down tightly so the tags can\'t get pulled out.  The tags are soft ribbons with different designs on each. This will be a favorite for years.",5

I agree with the previous poster who said that if you\'re installing in an old (i.e. not square) house, mount the hinge side first, then use the gate itself to locate the proper positioning for the latch side. Instead of depending on going by the instructions step by step, be sure to identify all the parts ahead of time and then do a dry fit first.I installed the gate at the bottom on some stairs that had an angled wall on one side and it worked well. Recommended.",4
"2331","Cosco Scenera Convertible Car Seat Black","My 1-year old likes it. The material is a little thin, so it feels like you\'re sitting right on the plastic frame with no cushion.

My 6-month-old son fell face first onto it while crawling and it cut his lip significantly---thank God it wasn\'t his eye. The edges are far too sharp and poorly molded---the plastic is HARD. I am surprised this passed inspection or safety standards. Use at 3 mos makes no sense.",1

"2335","UPPABaby Vista Car Seat Adapter, Peg Perego Black","I bought this over two years ago and was using this a lot for the first 12 months of my son. It works reasonably well and the only complain I have is that sometimes it might take a little bit longer to snap the car seat in place and had to wiggle it back and forth until the ""snap"". On the other hand, there was absolutely no problem disconnecting the car seat from the base. I also like the fact that I could use the bar as handle to lift and carry the uppababy stroller.",4
"2336",NA,"FunBites comes in two designs and makes getting kids excited about eating easier. What do kids love more than food their size?When I first used this on the prince\'s lunch, he actually sat and ate his entire lunch without fussing or trying to get up and play. He kept picking up the little cubes, looking at me with a sweet smile on his face and saying ""baby."" His lunch now usually consists of something cut into cubes.I have been wanting to try out kabobs since the prince loves his grill toy, but I honestly didn\'t want to cut all those things by hand, but now I can! I am going to explore toddler kabobs, I just have to figure out what to put them on.I think this is a genius product and is much easier than cutting it into cubes ourselves.The only thing about the product is that because it is all plastic, cutting takes a little patience, but I\'m okay with that. Because it is all plastic, when the little guy gets older, I can let him do it himself. I love things that can little by little teach him to be independent.FunBites.com has a gallery of lunch ideas- I love getting inspiration.I love that I can now turn his lunch into artwork, and cannot wait to see what else FunBites come up with as amazing shapes.They retail for $12.99 on Funbites.com and there is even a special. If you buy both, they are $22.00 for the set.My verdict: Definitely worth it and adds a huge fun factor to lunch!",5

We\'ve washed them all a number of times, and so far no issues.  I\'d recommend drying on the low setting, as the instructions say.I gave 4 stars because the full size mattress protector is designed to fit a wide variety of mattress depths and is a little big on our full.

But, after a few months of using it, the velcro does not hold shut whatsoever. It just flops open, even if I press down carefully and &#34;seal&#34; it. There are no pieces of fuzz or string keeping the velcro from doing its job, it just doesn\'t stick. I\'ve never seen velcro that fails like this. I\'ve contacted customer service, and they asked me to send a picture of the defective velcro (not sure how you could tell from a picture, but I did it anyway, assuming it was just part of their protocol). I never heard back from them. It\'s unfortunate because the bags are cute and useful as coolers, but I pretty much just have to put it in another bag because it will not stay shut. Now that my baby is eating snack foods, it means that string cheese, fruit, and whatever else we are packing inside is going to spill out. Disappointing.",3

This one has all the features needed for the purpose. I was hesitant initially to buy this for its color. I was looking for Bright colors for the baby. So I never bothered to look at this product when I began my search. Being mom I was looking for the best irrespective of the price. This one has all the features, Safest design, Height adjustments, back and foot inclination(needed as I have a big baby and other tiny & narrow seats were tough when we tried at some stores.), most of all Very easy to clean.Even the seat cover comes off to dust any pieces of food - just lift it and wipe off if needed after each use.. The tray is large enough unlike many tiny ones.Easy to maneuver - a little tight on carpet. I have been using it since a month and my baby and I love it.Height adjustment works awesome as My husband is 6ft and I am 5.2 ft, only thing is I feel difficult to adjust it with the bay in it(again she is big baby -98% of weight and height). Best of all the Swivel tray thing is awesome and easy with one hand..snap it to lock and press of button(red) to unlock.the tray is  dishwasher safe..easy to clean. With 10 month old trying to feed herself - cant imagine without this high chair. OVerall this is All in One...again bright colors would have been more attractive(no big deal for the pros it has).",5

It has been a lifesaver to put her in the highchair at the dining room table and actually get a chance to eat before my food goes cold.  She is 5 months and hasn\'t been able to pull the suction off.  It does come un-suctioned occasionally, but I find if I attached it with a little water right before she uses it - it works great.  She LOVES to spin the toy, and while I always seem to set the music off, she hasn\'t quite figured it out yet.  When she does accidentally set off - she\'s so happy.  I received this toy as a gift and want to recommend it to every mom.  I told my husband about the negative reviews its received b/c of the music, his comment was:  ""As long as she\'s (the baby) not crying, I could care less what the music sounds like"".  That about sums it up - baby toys make noise, but crying babies make louder, more annoying noises.",5

It seems to hold the car seat our a little ways from the stroller which makes the stroller canopy unusable for my infant leaving only the car seat canopy for sun shade which is not very big.  At first I felt the car seat was little to vertical for my liking, but my infant doesn\'t seem to mind it.

Only downside is that the warning sticker (shown in picture) is located on the inside headboard area----and is difficult to remove.  Just take your time and peel it away inch by inch. Prepare to strip off many little annoying pieces,and in the end it\'s gone.  That probably took as long as the assembly process did, haha.I know this is a &#34;mini crib&#34; but really---even in a full sized nursery, there is no reason anyone needs a bigger crib.

"2374","Evenflo Summit Easy Walk-Thru Gate","I was hopeful for this gate because I like the way it opens, my toddlers wouldn\'t be able to figure it out.  When I tried to install it I wasn\'t able to secure it using the extension, even though it was as tight as it could be (probably tighter than it should have been).  When I tried to shake it, like the toddlers would, it was very unstable and wobbled at the joint of the gate and extension.  I was even able to shake it out of the doorway.  I tried to re-install it twice.  Needless to say, I am returning it.I have a similar gate without an extension and it works just great!  So I am sure this would have worked if I didn\'t need the extension.",3
"2375","Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","Love this product.  It makes bath time much easier.  I\'m only giving it one star because it requires a lot of maintenance.  It takes forever to dry.  The only way I can get it dry is to hang it outside in the sun.  Hanging inside takes 2-3 days to dry.  With an infant, it\'s hard to find time to hang outside and remember to bring back in.  It\'s sure to mold with the 2 day drying time.  Guess I will be trashing it soon.",1
"2376","Itzy Ritzy Snack HappensSnack Mini Reusable Snack Bag, Social Circle Pink, 2-Count","We use these to carry snacks for our toddler. I love keeping one in my purse, and while the snacks do sometimes get crushed, I don\'t have to worry about the bag ripping and leaving crumbs all over my purse! That would most certainly happen if we used a plastic bag, so these are great. I like that you can wash and reuse. Our daughter even knows that when she sees them, her snack is coming right up!",5

"2378","DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01","After two months of little sleep and many failed attemps to get my colicky baby to stop crying I bought the DEX Sound Sleeper.  I didn\'t think that it would work, since nothing else had.  But to my surprise (and my husband\'s) it did.  I can now lay her down for naps and bedtime in her bassinnet with the ""womb"" setting on and she sleeps.  It has really helped to get her on a schedule.  My 18 month old was an easy baby, so this has been tough to deal with, but not now.  My newborn is awake a lot more and not crying as much when she is.  During the day, I can set her in her vibrating bouncy seat, womb sound playing and she\'s a happy camper and I can play with her sister or even get some house work done.  Plus, I\'m getting sleep at night, which makes Mommy happy.",5

She loves moving from side to side and turning in every position to see what\'s going on. She really enjoys stomping her feet to play music. She enjoys playing and reaching for toys although some toys are more challenging then others to reach. All in all, I get to be hands free to cook dinner while she plays in enjoyment.",5
"2382","Boon Flair Pedestal Highchair with Pneumatic Lift,White/Orang","I don\'t know what I would do without this highchair.  Where do I start.  First its a breeze to clean up which is VERY important when you have a million other things to do.  I just spray the chair with cleaner then wipe off,  second the fact that the tray is not large is also a plus since its less wiping down.  I love how you can buy multiple liners so that one can be in the sink to be cleaned and another can be popped on when time to feed kiddo.  Third is the rolling base.  God this saves me everyday.  I can just position the highchair anywhere I want without any force tugging, pulling, pushing.  Get this highchair.",5

"2384","Leachco Snoogle Loop Contoured Fit Body Pillow, Ivory","I am 8 months pregnant, and after our most recent growth spurt just could not find a way to get comfortable enough to get ANY good sleep at all.  It was getting pretty bad.  I had tried a small wedge, (by boppy, I think) ~ urrgghh, too hard and too small to make any kind of helpful difference.  I ordered the giant U shaped pillow, which almost by itself kicked my husband out of our queen size bed.  I  revisited all the maternity pillow products, re reading every description, thinking about my sleeping pattern & wondering what might be best.  I decided on this one, and have had 3 nights of blissfully peaceful and restful sleep, for the first time in weeks!!!What I love ~ that this goes almost 360 around you, but has the opening on the side, not the bottom.  I put the opening on the outside edge of the bed for easy exit.  No midnite run problems, easy out, easy back in.  I love the curvy shape on the opposite side, which I put on my left, as that is where we are ""supposed"" to spend the most time sleeping (so as not to crush the vena cava vein with the heavy uterus, possibly leading to oxygen deprivation).I love having somewhere to elevate my ankles, which eases water retention and lower back pressure after all day, I can sit and read for hours like this without moving, until it is time to get on my side to go to sleep.  I love the ease of turning back & forth from right to left sides, without re arranging 5 pillows to do so.  I love that this fits really nicely into our queen size bed, and I can still see, feel, and find my husband during the night; and he still has a full side of the bed.  Big points there!I love being surrounded by something that enfolds me, keeps me in a comfortable and healthy position, with the exception of a few turns, for most of the night.  Even if I find myself awake and a little sleepless, I am lying there in total comfort, with my thoughts, and not tossing and turning in search of the perfect position, or wondering where the super squishy abs pillow went, or how to turn my belly yet again.  It is brilliant, and will be saving my sanity, especially as I got back to work for another month or so, and really need every minute of sleep to be able to do so.Basically, for me, this pillow fulfills every requirement I was looking for.  The ONLY thing I have noticed is that because I spend a lot more time sleeping deeply in one position, I may wake up a little stiffer for a few minutes, since I was not doing flips all night long.  Such a problem to have, right?!It may not be for everybody, but having been Goldilocks, and tried several others, and my own home made attempts, this one is JUST RIGHT!!!One last thing I would add ~ I see that some people complain about the curved seam on the neck portion being small, tight, and painful.  I never encountered that, because I put 2 really nice pillows (one firm & 1 squishy) on top of that part to keep my head elevated.  It did not even occur to me to squish my neck and shoulder into that curve, so it is not at all a problem for me.  Don\'t let that keep you from trying this great pillow!",5
"2385","Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump","I love this pump. It\'s quiet, small enough to fit in a purse and great to use while traveling.  Obviously this will vary woman to woman, but I can get 4-6 ounces of milk in 5-10 minutes with this pump.",5
"2386","BRICA Stretch-to-Fit Window Sun Shade","I bought these from target and they were the most expensive ones they sold so I thought &#34;they\'ve gotta be good!&#34; I have never given a product so few stars before so let me explain why I am giving this one only 1 star: because there is no option to give it ZERO stars!! This product is, hands down, the worst product I have bought for my kids...and they have a drum set... I have cleaned my windows repeatedly and they have never stayed stuck on the window for more than ten seconds at a time. They also seem liked they could be dangerous because they will pop off every suction cup but like one so it is just dangling there on my window and flapping all around the place when I take a tight turn. Boo, brica, you may make some good products but I will never know because this was the first, and last product I will buy from this brand...I hate these things THAT much...brica could come out with a product that changes your kids diapers for you and I still wouldn\'t buy it...boo...",1

"2390","Safety 1St/Dorel Oven Lock 241 Child Safety","We love this oven lock. It does what it is supposed to and the adhesive seems to be working extremely well. It was hard to attach at first because there are three pieces and with only two hands it\'s hard to hold all the pieces where they need to go. It doesn\'t get too hot to touch when the oven is on, which is great so that I can have it locked while I\'m cooking and then unlock it without getting burned to take the food out.",NA
"2391","The First Year\'s Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","Great tub. Simple. We did not use the net insert because our son sinks down in it too much. So for those first couple of baths it was just easier to do a sponge bath on the counter.Once his unbilical stump fell off we used the tub. It fits well in our kitch sink.",5
"2392","Safety 1st Secure Lock Bed Rail","This isnt THAT bad of a product, if it was the only one available I would reccomend it. But I have bought 2 of them now and I prefer the ""especially for toddlers"" over this one. (I think that is the brand) The reasons for my opinion are:1. Because it sits on top of the bed, it takes up too much of the mattress. Some people like this feature and say it seems more secure, but I think it is just as secure as the other one that has a strap that locks under the entire mattress. This one takes up a good 2-3 inches of my sons bed!2. Although not impossible to put together, it did require more effort than the other one. The other one needed no tools for assembly.3. It is cheaper- usually people think cheaper in price means cheaper in value, but this is not the case.Trust me on this one. I have had both brands and the especially for toddlers brand is a better buy. If that one isnt available, fine- buy this one.",2
"2393","Mobicam DL Digital Monitoring System","Recently I was given the opportunity to review the MobiCam Digital DL Wireless Audio/Video Monitoring System from Mobi Technologies for my blog (Mom Mart) and I have to say that this monitor is fabulous! We are constantly on the move visiting family and friends whenever possible and need baby gear that can keep up with us and our highly mobile family. The MobiCam Digital DL can keep up with our family and then some. The bells and whistles offered with this device are outstanding.The screen is not too little and not too big; it\'s just the right size without compromising on portability and the quality of video display.There is no static or signal interruption and thanks to the new DigiLock Wireless with FHSS technology, I don\'t worry about neighbors or truck drivers picking up my monitor\'s signal and listening in on or watching my family.There are multiple ways to monitor using this system. There is the picture/audio mode, the audio only mode, and the VOX (voice activation) mode. My favorite mode is the VOX mode because it saves battery power.There is an extra wide angle on the camera! I can see what is going on in the room, not just a small section of the bed where my child may or may not be sleeping.There is a sound bar located at the top of the display that allows me to see the noise level, so I don\'t have to listen to screaming or crying but I can still see what is going on. This is fabulous for time-outs and temper tantrums.It works day or night. I love that I do not have to leave a light on in the nursery in order to see what is going on at night. The infrared night vision is crisp and clear and allows me to see my baby no matter what time it is. The infrared light is not bright at all, so it doesn\'t wake my baby once it is triggered to come on.There is room to grow with this video/audio monitor. Although it only comes with one camera, the MobiCam is built to work with up to four cameras. After reading the directions and re-linking my original camera I think adding additional cameras would be quite easy to do. There is even an automatic scanning option you can use to alternate between cameras.This monitoring system is incredibly easy to use. There is no installation required, it is ready to use as soon as you take it out of the box.I love that the camera and monitor both operate on AC or AA Alkaline Batteries (not included). I have options! If my batteries die and I don\'t have any replacements I can simply plug in the camera and/or monitor without missing a beat.There is a USB output for you to connect to your computer for Internet viewing via another PC or cell phone with the optional MobiCam Anywhere software. This monitoring system has the capability to work with video chat outlets such as Skype, Messenger, GoogleTalk, and Yahoo. I love this feature, especially since I have a tendency to take my boys on mini-vacations to visit family, leaving my husband at home to fend for himself. I have not had the opportunity yet to test out this fabulous feature, but I am looking forward to giving it a go the next trip I take!I was not paid to write this review, I just LOVE this product. I was supplied with a MobiCam Digital DL Monitoring System for the purposes of a blog review. I was such a fan of this product that I wanted to share my experiences on Amazon as well, since this is where I do a majority of my online shopping.",5

"2410","Leachco The Natural - Contoured Nursing Pillow - Pink Pin Dot","I have used Bobbies and others. Now for my third child I have found this one and love it.This fits well around you without leaving gaps. Your baby will snuggle close to you and you can adjust it when baby gets older so that you can elevate the baby, give a bit more head up or however she prefers to nurse.The pillow snuggles right in and around you. PERFECT for rocking chairs.But also to just for lap use, like on a couch or such. I have one for upstairs and one for downstairs.It moves right in as the pictures shows. The baby is NOT laying off the pillow, as shown in the pictures, unless you want her to.I love that it doesn\'t show stains. I have a pink one and the color is beautiful. Soft but not pastel. It never loses shape. Bounces right back or stays soft but in shape.As you can tell I am really happy and satisfied with it. Can recommend it.Note: it has no changing option. It is one peace and you can\'t take the cover off.LOVE the prodcut. Never felt that satisfied or happy with any of the other nursing pillows.Especially the Bobby pillow. It never fit right nor around me.Usually things are made for shorter women, but I am 6 feet it works well for me.My friends who are shorter have come over and used it for their baby and it works well for them also.Doesn\'t lose shape or firmness.It is soft to touch but feels like a very good pillow you would rest your head on.Enjoy it.",5
"2411","The First Years Soothie Newborn Pacifiers, Boy","My newborn had jaundice within 24 hours of birth... so he was under UV lights in the hospital. He had to wear an eyemask (not to mention couldn\'t be held very often!), and was NOT happy about it. The hospital staff gave us one of these pacifiers to use.While it seemed to soothe him (at least, he wasn\'t screaming anymore), I did notice a change in his latch. We had had no problems breastfeeding (he latched on 15 minutes after being born!), but after using this pacifier we had a meeting or two with the lactation consultant.We switched to using one of the orthodontic pacifiers (the Born Free ones, specifically) and later, the MAM orthodontic type; while these impacted his latch less, there was still a difference. We aren\'t using pacifiers right now because of this (he\'s 2 weeks old). When we were using them, he could still breastfeed okay, but it was more uncomfortable and took longer to get him latched... and with a hungry baby, every second seems to count. :)Moral of the story: wait until ""breastfeeding is well-established"" before giving this to your baby.",3
"2412","Fisher-Price Cradle \'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","Baby boy refused to nap more than 25 minutes at a time at two months of age. I was putting him in his crib, which he doesn\'t dislike, but it was driving me crazy that he didn\'t get enough daytime sleep (and I didn\'t, either!). I bought the monkey version of this swing out of desperation. He didn\'t take to it right away, but with some persistence, swaddling, and white noise it became a place I could put him where he would happily and IMMEDIATELY fall asleep, and nap for 2 hours or more. That is worth it\'s weight in gold. Highly recommend if your baby needs a little help with napping. Obviously I will eventually transition him to the crib for naps, but for now, we are getting on a nap schedule and he is learning to fall asleep on his own. I am so grateful for this item.",5
"2413","Baby Trend Expedition Jogger, Hanna","I had a Baby Trend Expedition with my older son that did not have the swivel front wheel.

"2414","Dr. Brown\'s 3-pack 8-ounce Standard Bottles","I LOVE these bottles.  My daughter had so much excess gas she hated to eat.  We tried so many different bottles like Evenflo, AVENT (which were horrible!) and VentAire.  The VentAire helped but I figured I would try Dr. Brown\'s.  It\'s nothing short of a miracle!

"2418","Chicco Keyfit Car Seat Base","Please ignore the reviewer who rated the seat one star due to the rebound issue. I am a certified child passenger safety technician and this is NOT a safety concern. Almost all rear facing seats will rebound in a crash. The only ones that won\'t are infant seats with rigid LATCH (the only one currently available in the US is the Baby Trend Latch-Loc with rigid LATCH) or one with an anti-rebound bar like the Britax Companion and convertible seats that tether rear facing (all Britax convertible seats, Sunshine Kids Radian, etc). As long as your seat moves less than an inch in any direction AT THE BELT PATH (i.e. on an infant seat with a base, right at the seat crack where the other poster said it was tight) it is safe. The Chicco KeyFit is a very good seat. It is without a doubt one of the best on the market currently. It installs like a dream and fits small babies very well. As a tech of seven years, I would not hesitate to recommend this seat or use it for my own child.",5
"2419","Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink","We pulled this out of the box already assembled and our 14 month old daughter immediately sat down and started rocking! She was thrilled with it and we are too. I wouldn\'t recommend for bigger kids but it looks like it will work from ages 1-3 or so. Definitely worth $50. Will be buying another one I\'m sure. We did buy scotchgard to make it somewhat toddler proof and I would recommend that everyone do so to make the microsuede last. We\'ve had to do this with our couch because our daughter always has something sticky on her. :)",5

"2424","Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary)","I used the Playtex drop in bottles (with the liners) with my 2 older children, and was happy with how they worked for my babies. The Playtex VenAire bottle uses the same nipple as the Drop In Bottles, which is a great nipple for a baby who is also breastfeeding. I was skeptical at first about using a bottle with a bent neck; I thought I wouldn\'t like it. But it is only slightly bent, and seems to help in getting the milk into the nipple instead of air. The bottle is comfortable to hold while feeding baby.The bottom of the bottle has a ring that you screw on. Because the bottom removes, I find that makes cleaning the bottle easier that a bottle that does not have a removable bottom. The vents at the bottom of the bottle allow air to flow out, which means your baby will swallow less air and have less gas. My baby doesn\'t burp or spit up a lot, so I assume that means it\'s working.Overall, I\'m happy with these bottles, and my baby has no problems with them either.",5
"2425","Harmony V6 Highback Booster Seat, Black Tech","I researched narrower boosters and this one came up. I am fully on-board with liking it. It is one of up to three seats that fits int he back of my 2010 Forrester (along with a Bubble Bum and a Britax). It\'s part of the only configuration that I find truly works for all the kiddos.I have two qualms with this seat:Belt guides are  hard to get the belt in and out of across the lap, so I\'m often wasting time trying to slide the belt through the too narrow opening.Over-the shoulder clip for the seat belt (to be used without the back). Could absolutely NOT get the accompanying pin to go in the hole for securing the guide. It\'s not important no, but it will be when my little guy is a bit bigger. This was very disappointing but I figure I can work around it..Overall, however, great, compact booster.",4

"2427","The First Years Compass B540 Booster Seat, Abstract O\'s","This carseat had good safety ratings so I bought it for my 4.5 year old.  He likes it; makes him feel like a big boy.

"2428","Boba Air Baby Carrier, Black","The Boba Air is such a great carrier! Is super light and folds up into its own attached pouch so I can put it into the diaper bag or throw it into the car whenever I think I might need it! Plus my hubby will wear this one! There is no padding on the shoulder straps but it is so comfortable anyways. My daughter (3 years old and 35lbs) and my son (12 months old and 24lbs) both enjoy riding in this and I have not felt uncomfortable at all wearing either of them! LOVE IT!!!!!! Thank you Boba!!!",5
"2429","Infantino Jumbo Patchwork Play Space","This rug is colorful and very creative. The animals and shapes and the velcroed pieces (a bee, a flower that sings ""you are my sunshine, a mirror) and the sewed in parts (rings and other shapes) make it have it all. My daughter has it since she was 5 months and now she is almost a year old. Even though she already walks, she loves sitting on the rug and ""talking"" to the monkey and the lion. She also loves to throw herself on it, lying down on her back to be funny. I love that it is washable. She spills juice and chocolate milk on it all the time, and I wash it and put it in the dryer, it comes out just fine, as good as new.",5
"2430","The First Years Deluxe Changing Pad with Sides","Exactly what I needed. We keep this in the truck since we are always on the go with older kids sports. It keeps the baby in place and has plenty of room. Has survived the diaper blow-outs like a champ! Surface is easily wipeable so the big messes are no big deal. The convenience of having a sturdy & sanitary changing table right in the vehicle has definitely made our outings a little less stressful... which is a huge plus with a new baby. I\'ll be buying one of these for baby shower gifts from now on.",5

She is only three months old and loves to be rocked. the only disappointment was that I thought it looked green,. However, when it arrieved the color is beige. It does match well anyway. It is extremly comfortable. She has already been rocked to sleep. I hope it holds up well . Im looking forward to putting it to the test of time.After having this a few months I change my mind. The cushions and seat support do not hold up. Also, one of the arms comes loose and must be jarred back into place. Too bad. I would not recommend this.",2

"2433","Evenflo Portable BabySuite 300, Marianna","Since finding out we were expecting, we have been searching high and low for a good economical pack n\' play option since we are doing quite a bit of moving. This pack n\' play was more than I could have asked for and THEN SOME. The ease of use, simple setup/assembly, and detailed instruction manual made it pain-free to get this setup and ready for my kiddo. There were quite an abundance of tags which I had to cut off (only for aesthetic reasons, which is why I don\'t take stars away for that) but it wasn\'t something that 5 minutes and a pair of scissors couldn\'t fix. We had been scared away from pack n\' plays due to horror stories, but this one completely put my mind at rest and made me question how others could have had so many issues.If you\'re looking for a trouble-free, aesthetically pleasing, durable pack n\' play (whether for co-sleeping, activities, changing, etc) this is a no-brainer and definitely worth every cent paid.",5
"2434","Oh Plah Teething Bracelet, Dark Plum","I love the concept of chewable, baby-safe jewerly. Love these bracelets - kiddo can chomp on them all day. But so far my 6 month old has no interest in this bracelet - I love the look, and it goes with all my outfits, but he just won\'t go for it. He opts for chewbeads every time...EDIT - Now that he\'s 9 months and REALLY teething he loves this bracelet. I love the look, easy to jazz up an outfit and a lot more funky looking than Chewbeads. I alternate between the two. And he loves chomping on them all!",5

I think they are just too hard compared with a real human nipple.  Soft rubber (or latex) paci\'s are hard to find so I was thrilled to find these after my daughter tried and refused every other non-silicone paci I could find (including the ones her bother loved and much pricier ones imported from other countries).  However, the nipple on the NB one is the same size as the 2+ one.  The only difference is the size of the plastic part on the outside.  My 7 lb newborn was just fine with the next size up.  Oh and I love the included microwave sterilizer.  Bonus!",5

"2440","Sony NTMV1 Video Baby Monitor","I have had 2 Summer Infant monitors, and also a Motorola. The Summer Infant monitors had terrible reliability, and I got a green screen on one of them within 1 week of purchase. The Motorola had a very grainy night vision and also very slow motion, I also returned that quickly. This Sony was my last hope to buy a decent monitor that does what it is supposed to do. I do trust Sony brand and had tons of their electronics. This unit is very nice, the picture is clearer than the other 2 mentioned above. It looks like good build quality, and I am very happy with the purchase. Hopefully this one will stand solid long term and last us at least a couple years. If you are tired of poor quality baby monitors, give this Sony a try.Update 4 months later.. the wireless cuts out a few times each night. I do NOT think this is a product problem, probably more to do with the wireless networks all over my house, and also the uverse wireless cablel box stuff. Might have to try a different unit though, i had to turn it off last night so it would stop beeping.",NA

I\'m not going to type out everything that\'s in the kit because you just read the description, but it is a very good kit with lots of goodies to keep your child safe. The case is very durable and has lots of room for additional necessities. Some reviewers complain that there are stuff lacking or not enough of, but all you have to do is go to Target and add stuff you need. The kit has plenty of room. II keep this in my car for my boyfriend\'s child just in case of an emergency. I think every parent should have one of these in their car that way it\'s everywhere they go you just never know.",5
"2447","bumGenius One-Size Cloth Diaper Twilight","Like most parents to be, my husband and I read the reviews and made our purchase in advance.  The bum genius had the best reviews, and we felt confident in purchasing enough to meet our cloth diapering needs before our son was born.  Sadly, it didn\'t work out...perhaps because we ended up having a long, lean baby with relatively larger thighs.  The bumgenius seemed tight in the legs while never fitting well in the waist.  Our baby never seemed comfortable, and we never made the switch fully to cloth diapers.  My advice to parents to be - WAIT until your baby is born, and try a bunch of different cloth diapers.  All babies are different, and there is no perfect diaper for every child.  The fuzzibunz seem to be a better fit for our baby, and we will be trying them next.  I like that Fuzzibunz has adjustable elastic in the legs, which allows us to fit our hard to fit baby.",3

I had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung. More bad news... I purchased the Ultimate Wipes Warmer, which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table. Perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table, but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type.",2

I started trying use them when the babies were around 10 months old.  All three of them immediately ripped the bibs off and threw them in the floor, food flying everywhere.

It is just like I don\'t even have a highchair. My mother bought the same item also. She loves it also. It is also great for if you are traveling. It is light weight and easy to carty.

"2456","Snazzy Baby Knee Pads, Ocean Blue","I wasn\'t sure if this would fit my 2 year old since all the reviews seemed to be coming from parents of infants just learning to crawl.  My daughter seemed to be going through a clumsy stage where she\'d skin her knee then re-open the same scab again and again by falling some more.  I was worried that she\'d be left with permanent scars (which isn\'t the end of the world, but is a sort of unsightly reminder on my own legs of my rough and tumble tomboy childhood), so I got these kneepads.  I can tell that they are a fairly high quality item, made with plenty of padding and stitched very well.  The velco is adjustable; I can see that they could be a bit bulky for a crawling infant, but it will certainly last you through your walking and biking toddler years too.  They fit my daughter just fine, but I have to say that unfortunately, she refused to wear them for very long.  She couldn\'t get the velcro off herself, but she managed to push the whole kneepad down her leg to her ankles.  Oh well, it was a great idea and well executed.",5
"2457","OiOi Baby Dot Messenger Bag, Char/Lime","I like this diaper/changing bag. Especially the inside is well designed with its several little compartments. What I don\'t like about it is the fact that you can\'t adjust the carrying strap. And it smells perfumed, it is not a bad smell but some people might be sensitive. I would say it is not necessary to perfume a diaper/changing bag. But all in all a good and well designed bag with all compartments you need and a lot of room to take all necessary stuff with you. It also comes with a little change mat.",4

Oh and how the snugli\'s hurt my back and my twins were little. Then when I had my next son the twins were 2 and I didn\'t want a triple stroller so I read reviews of baby bjorn and how awesome they were. I was skeptical but they were redesigning them so I found one fairly inexpensive maybe $50(I can\'t recall) I bought it and have told all of friends to defiantely spend the extra money on Baby Bjorn there is just no comparison. I am using it on my 4th baby now and she is over 17lbs and it doesn\'t bother my back at all and she loves to face out and see everyone especially her crazy brothers.

I even warmed up the car for a while in my garage to see if heating the windows helps.

"2467","Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","We bought two of these shortly before our son was born, and I could not be happier.  I purchase them on Amazon because they were cheaper than where we registered (I think they were on sale at the time).  He is now 11 months old and we have been using these ever since he was transitioned to his crib at around 3-4 months old.  They are incredible time savers!  They snap on easily and quickly, they are really easy to take off (just pull it off), wash up wonderfully in the washing machine, can go in dryer no problem, and are actually very soft fabric.  They are waterproof but don\'t feel rubbery or like plastic on the side the baby sleeps on.  Our son loves them so much, he actually won\'t sleep in his crib until we have one on.  He has peed, pooped, and vomited on these things and they still look and feel great after over 7 months of use.  We have never had the problem of him getting stuck underneath it.  It stretches tight enough to the slats on his crib that he can\'t get it off the mattress.  The best part is the same as everyone else said, you don\'t have to change the cute sheets underneath it, so you don\'t have to worry about taking off the bumpers, lifting the mattress, etc. for those middle of the night messes.  Just snap off, snap on!  Also, having the Ultimate Crib Sheet be a plain solid color is a really good idea.  My son gets too distracted by the little figures on his regular sheets and spends time trying to pick them off his sheets instead of going to sleep.As everyone else has said, if you are going to get this product, I would definitely buy two so you have an extra that can go on the bed while the other is in the laundry.",NA

Now it is a breeze and i love it.it strolls like a dream and my son is quite content in it.  The sun shade goes all the way down to the stroller tray and theres little pockets for your items everywhere.  another nice surprise was the adjustable foot rest.

If you have the reusable ones, you need to use the clear nipples, not the blue tinted ones.  If you use the blue ones, the nipple will colapse and milk will spill everywhere.

"2486","BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","Our 2010 model was recently stolen so we had to purchase the more recent model.Can I just say that I am a huge BOB fan! I worked as a nanny for 10 years and always insisted my families had a BOB stroller. It is undoubtedly the best stroller in the world! When my first baby was due in 2011 I immediately purchased one, the orange, brown and cream revolution SE with all the accessories. It happened to be the 2010 model and I loved it! It went to the UK 3 times and I ran 4 miles every day with it. Never a problem with it, I continued to rave about how wonderful it was to anyone who would listen!!Unfortunately on a trip over Christmas it was stolen. I was so upset. Money is tight as I am a stay at home military wife but I knew I couldn\'t be without my BOB so immediately started looking to see if I could replace it with the exact same model. Unfortunately I couldn\'t find any so purchased the new model from Amazon with their wonderful 2 day delivery. I figured well it won\'t be exactly the same but this is a newer and maybe even better version.I\'m sorry to say I am disappointed and missing my old stroller more than ever. Initially I didn\'t like the new material or the orange and grey color as much but figured I just wasn\'t used to it. Then when I collapsed the stroller to put it in the car I didn\'t care for the plastic handles replacing the red metal ones on the handlebar nor the small black knobs on the side of the stroller which actually hurt my hands, I much preferred the feel of the larger red knobs.My biggest disappointment was when I put my son inside and realized this stroller seems smaller! His feet are more squished together and he seems to sit taller in it so the hood is in the way of his head. I never saw anything online about this model being a different size so I was shocked. Perhaps I would be happier if I had nothing to compare it to but I miss the older version :(",3

"2489","Baby Brezza Perfect Measure Formula Dispenser","I am so confused about all the negative reviews. We absolutely LOVE the dispenser and kettle. Making a bottle is SOOOO much easier and quicker. I can understand why people say the formula still goes everywhere. You have to be precise on where the bottle is. But if you practice on where to put the bottle and do the same thing every time, Its spot on. I am also reading you cant do it while holding a baby, really? I do, and its not hard at all. Also reading that the amt that comes out is bigger than the amt needed. Not true for us. I tried it 4 times and the same amt came out each time and I compared the amt with the scoop that came with our formula container and it was the exact amt. Not sure whats up with all the negative reviews. Sorry people didnt like it cause we love it. This is one of the best baby things we have boughten!  Just practice using the lever, where to put the bottle and it will be spot on every time!!!!! LOVE THIS",5

Overall function is great.",4

"2492","Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer, Blue","this item does what it says. it takes the stress out of ""when did we last feed the baby?"" as a new parent my memory and sanity suffered but this helped me keep track of things. the one downfall is that i don\'t use it as often now that my baby is 4 months and much more predictable. however, this is still a great gadet to have around for parents who are switching off and/or sitters.... they won\'t have to guess when the last time the baby was changed. it also feels great when you can press all the buttons! knowing your baby is fed, changed, and napping is a great feeling. my one recommendation is that it would have been awesome if somehow it can add the oz drank and i would have liked it if the sleep times totaled. good gift for the first time mom!",4

They are very soft and nice from a cushioning standpoint with babies learning to pull up, stand, and walk but who are wobbly maneuvering on their mattresses. Much softer to fall onto than the crib rail for sure! They launder well and are maybe not the most beautiful thing in the world, but they do not detract from the look for the nursery either. They blend in well, even on a dark wood crib. Great product!",5

They were on sale on Amazon so I purchased it. They come in a set of 4Metal Bells - that\'s my favorite! It\'s very well made and can get quite loud... you can shake them anyway you want and they make this get jinglebell sound (great for Xmas time!!)Plastic beads - I like this one a lot too... you can also shake it anyway you want and this one is less loud than the bells and not as heavy so it\'s good for younger babiesPlastic Clasps - This one is okay, you have to shake it up and down so it makes the sound...Plastic covered metal tambourine - you would have to shake this one side to side... This is probably my less favorite one.Overall, I think these are very well made (it should be given these are not cheap for shakers) But you want to get something sturdy and not cheap for shakers. Your baby is shake it, bang it, throw it, and drop it from the highchair so you want quality toys that would fall part!",NA
"2505","MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer","I\'ve used this thermometer for the past 15 months for my daughter and it\'s been remarkably consistent.  I would recommend using tympanic membrane readings (ear) as this is a much more reliable way to measure temperature if done correctly.  To measure: Pull external ear up and back slightly, and aim thermometer level (not up or down) but slightly toward front of head - this positioning ensures you are measuring temperature at the membrane, not the ear canal.  The memory feature is very handy.  The back light is unobtrusive.  My daughter dislikes the electronic voice that gives you a verbal on the reading, but otherwise, this medical doctor finds this thermometer to be great!",5

"2508","Sliding Closet Door Lock 2-Pack","Really the only thing stopping me from giving five stars is that they\'re not the most attractive things in the world. However, they work perfectly for our needs. Our cats enjoy opening all sliding doors then investigating (read: playing havoc with) everything behind those doors. These locks completely prevent them from opening the doors anymore and are easy to operate.

Just press the flaps straight, open the door, and when you close it, they fall back into position automatically, without getting stuck.",4

"2512","Today\'s Mom Cozy Cuddler Pregnancy Pillow - White","I decided to get this maternity pillow because it was on sale and it got decent reviews here on Amazon. First, let me just say that the pillow case is ITCHY and it is made with a very CHEAP FABRIC. I am 5 months pregnant in the middle of the summer (JULY) and I cannot sleep because I am constantly perspiring and itchy. I even washed the pillow case a few times with a softener and it just didn\'t help. Now let\'s proceed to the pillow itself - the pillow is FLIMSY and not firm at all!!! So what is the point of having a pillow that supposedly should help you with your back?!? I have to constantly move the contents of the pillow (I don\'t really know what\'s in it - def not real COTTON if you ask me!) Regular firm pillows are way much better if you ask me. Do not waste your money on a product that does NOT do its job!!! You will thank me I promise you! :)",1

I fill mine with a little bathroom cleaner each time I clean the bathroom and rinse them out. So far, I haven\'t had a problem, but that\'s the nature of bath toys that you can\'t reach to clean. They\'re not expensive so just replace them if it becomes a problem.",5
"2514","SoYoung Charlie Unisex Diaper Bag (slate/charcoal)","As all new mothers, I searched a long time before buying my 2nd diaper bag as the 1st one wasn\'t working out. (my first one was a lower priced skiphop bag)I bought this bag, although the price was above my budget, because of the large insulation pocket. I recently took this bag out on a day trip and couldn\'t believe what fitted in there.In the insulated pocket I had, one 8oz Dr Brown bottle (fits standing up), sippy cup, 2  x 4oz containers with food and one banana + spoons. In the main compartment I had her back up outfit, 5 diapers, wipes, stuffed animal, hoodie, formula dispenser, sunhat, pacifier, bibs. In the mommy pocket, my credit card wallet, 2 sunscreen bottles, cell phone, sunglasses. Through the large item pocket I had a folded receiver blanket.So yes it does fit a lot and the bag looks very compact, with all of this in there I still had great oversight. The clear pockets in the main compartment and the contrast lining work very well.Also, my husband doesn\'t mind carrying this bag at all, that was important to us.Why not 5 stars, the side pockets with insulation are very small, they fit a small sippy cup well (without the handles) but not very good for a bottle, they aren\'t high enough.The smart phone pocket is not wide enough for an iphone and the sunglass pocket is rather small too, my sunglasses don\'t fit easily. But that is not the reason why I bought the bag, although since it is in there it would be nice to be able to use it. The main reason for the 4 stars is that the shoulder strap is not padded, it would be nice to have little bit of padding on the shoulder strap especially because the bag does carry a lot of items.Overall, a great bag, worth the money I believe.(other options considered : babymel messenger diaper bag, oioi man diaper bag and landsend)",4

"2516","Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair","I was looking for a portable seat to take places, and this actually just ended up being his chair at one of our two tables in our house, which is equally as nice so I don\'t have to keep moving his high chair depending on if we are eating at the formal dining table or the breakfast nook (It currently resides at the breakfast nook where we eat breakfast and lunch. I still use his highchair for dinner). I still don\'t have a portable seat that\'s super easy to take places (see cons) but I have a great seat, nonetheless!Pros:-Comfortable. My son could literally sit in this seat all day. He loves it.-Good for a second high chair or a permanent chair at the head of the table for your little one.Cons:-Food and crumbs easily get stuck under the arms and they are hard to move to clean out underneath them. So basically, crumbs sit in there until I muster up the strength to either wrench on the chair to move the arms, or I have to unscrew the tighteners all the way.-It does not come off and onto tables easily. It\'s kind of awkward where the spinners are that tighten it to the table.-The travel bag that comes with it is not nearly big enough. It folds up very awkwardly, not easily, and after I finally get it folded small enough, I cram it in the bag. AND then the bag doesn\'t have a drawstring. It has a string, but nothing to keep it closed, like a pressure button, so I have to tie a bow in it, which usually comes undone. And, another gripe about the travel bag, there\'s no handle on it. So you either have to carry it with two hands, or carry it by the drawstring, which is tiny and cuts into your fingers :)-The material it\'s made out of is kind of a cheap polyester type. I was scared to wash it, but it did wash up good.I didn\'t realize I had so many gripes about this chair because I honestly really like it. It\'s a good second chair for us. It\'s just not a good/easily portable chair. I recommend this for a \'booster\' seat or a seat that you want to have instead of a high chair.So in conclusion, good for a second or only high chair that is going to stay put, bad for portability and cleaning ease.:) Hope this helps. I feel like I was kind of all over the place in this review, but I hope someone can take something away from it.",NA

"2537","My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I recently bought this product for my 2 month old baby.  I already had the Bobby Pillow which is perfect for when I sit in my Glider Rocker; however, I did not like using the Bobby Pillow other than in that one chair.  The bobby pillow will shift out of position if you aren\'t sitting in a chair that will brace the sides of the bobby pillow.  This pillow holds the baby right in position, and if I need to temporariliy stand up while nursing the baby, the pillow stays in position.  This is perfect when I have to attend to my 2 year old daughter.  I like taking this pillow to other people\'s houses too because, I can sit on a sofa, a kitchen chair, a lawn chair, etc with a Nursing Cover.. and still nurse the baby comfortably where I never could do this before.  I found I can use this pillow while reclining on the sofa because even when I lean back, this pillow stays upright and still holds the baby up to my brest.  Wish I would have gotten this sooner.  For my first child, since I already had the Bobby, I thought this pillow was unnecessary.  I love the freedom and versatility this pillow provides.  So, I recommend owning BOTH Brest Friend and Bobby Pillow for comfortably brestfeeding.  (I even started exploring breast feeding in a Sleepy Wrap.)  To be successful at brestfeeding your second child, you need to have the freedom to move around so you can still take care of and enjoy your older child at the same time.",4

These cups feature a hard top that will not squish and are easy for my son to drink from. I have bought about 3 or 4 packs of these so we don\'t run out of clean ones in the event I don\'t have to do dishes every day.The simple design of these cups seems to be the best design for a sippy cup. I have never had a problem with these cups leaking - and they take a lot of abuse from my toddler.

Don\'t even think about letting them use them in the car!

"2550","Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station","I originally bought the Euro bath as it was rated highly in the Baby bargains book.  However, once our baby was big enough to use it, she kept sliding down and it looked VERY uncomfortable.  I tried putting a towel under her and behind her back, but it was just very frustrating.  I then bought the tubside bath seat, but didn\'t like that either.  The seat sits well over an inch above the bottom of the tub, so you need to use quite a bit of water to get it up to her legs.  I know you aren\'t supposed to use a lot of water, by my little girl likes to kick her legs and splash.  So, I finally bought the 4 in 1 tub.  I wish I had gotten it from infancy.  It has a sling to use when the baby is really tiny, then when your baby can sit, the blue piece spins around so your baby is supported in a circle.  Our baby is almost 10 months and I am just about ready to turn the blue piece so she doesn\'t have it in front of her anymore.  Once she is too big for that, we can then move into the Euro bath and hopefully get a few years out of that.  Why use a ton of water when you can fill one of these tubs instead.

BPA-Free Glass Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology and Bonus Silicone Sleeve, 3-Pack","I got these bottles because I prefer the idea of warming my baby\'s formula supplements in glass as opposed to plastic.Pros: the wide mouth makes it super easy and mess free when measuring and mixing formula.The ounce measurements are engraved in the glass so they will not fade away after multiple washings.Cons: the nipples that fit these bottles seem really long and tend to gag my son when he takes them in his mouth.There are so many pieces, nooks and crannies it seems much more laborious to clean and prepare these bottles. Get lots to have on hand especially with a newborn or it will seem overwhelming to get them washed and prepared by your next feeding when you are overtired and you need easy.We had an easier time latching and with cleanup, using some cheap evenflo plastic bottles that we had to buy for traveling.

"2572","The First Years Sweet Sleep Cocoon","For our first baby, we used (and loved) theFisher-Price Deluxe Bouncer, which costs nearly 2/3 less than this cocoon.  That bouncer could vibrate and play music, and most importantly could operate like a foot-powered rocking chair that magically soothed a cranky baby long enough to let us eat a hot meal.This cocoon can also rock, either front to back or, by turning the orientation of the seat, from side to side.  The rocking is not as easy to do with one foot as the Fisher-Price model, though, since that one relied on the spring tension of the legs (you could push down, and it would bounce back, and it was easy to get a good rhythm going).This has a few advantages over the Fisher-Price bouncer, that may or may not justify the dramatic increase in cost.  Its material is easy to wipe clean with a cloth (the Fisher-Price was absorbent and needed dis-assembly and machine-washing), it can recline farther back for sleep and farther upright for playtime, and includes a canopy for shading a sleeping child (although this isn\'t likely to be as necessary for an essentially indoor product).As others have noted, this is a challenge to put together, but since you should only have to do that once, it isn\'t too big of a deal.  The price is a bit high, however, for what it is, and I would still prefer the Fisher-Price even if they cost the same.",NA

I\'m a sprained, bruised and battered mess but my 4 yr. old barely has a scratch. She has two very slight lacerations near the top of each shoulder where the harness bit a little.

It is  not worth the price of the cup.  I think it is a genius idea with the straw moving with the liquid.

"2617","Summer Infant Carter\'s Love Bug Cuddle Me Bouncer","My mum purchased this bouncer for my daughter when she was born in June 2010. We were never big fans of the music (the sound quality is quite grating, perhaps caused by the high pitch of the music) but we used the nature sounds and womb sounds frequently as well as the vibration option to soothe my newborn daughter to sleep.Although it isn\'t recommended, when my daughter had trouble getting back to sleep at night, we would place her into the bouncer and she would happily snooze there until I got up the next morning; with it vibrating away and the womb sounds playing. Unfortunately they stop after a short while and we sometimes had to get up to restart it, otherwise she would wake up. The vibration/noise pack itself takes AA batteries and gets through them fairly quickly, particularly if you are using the bouncer a lot - rechargeable batteries would make a great accessory to purchase with this bouncer!The head rest is very poor in my opinion and serves no real function as a support for little heads - it is not attached (and has no way of being attached) so you just have to lay it in the bouncer, behind your baby\'s head and hope that they don\'t move and cause it to slip out of place. Even if it stays in place the edges are so flat that baby can easily slide to the side and end up laying on top of the headrest. We only used the headrest probably 2 times before discarding it - bunched up t-shirts do a much better job at supporting baby\'s head so he or she is not slumped completely to the side but can still rest their head comfortably. This is a minor issue in my opinion, but worth noting.We use this bouncer every day and my daughter is almost 6 months old now and still fits comfortably into it (she is a \'big\' baby (90th percentile for both height and weight)) but will still get plenty of use out of this bouncer.The straps that are used to secure baby in are comfortable, but now my daughter is old enough to lean over and try and roll, she can do it fairly easily - the part that goes between her legs is in a position ideal to support smaller, younger babies...but it would be much better if it could be adjusted to different positions, as it would hold an older baby in better if it could be moved forward. I strapped my daughter in the other day and nipped to the bathroom, came back and she was still strapped in, but basically doing a handstand on the floor - exactly why you should supervise your child at all times! It is something to note though, because I have been watching her while washing up and had to abandon my task temporarily to rush and stop my daughter from rolling herself out of the bouncer. I think this is an issue that most bouncers will have at this point, so good supervision of an older baby will prevent accidents.The structure itself is sound, there are screws holding the frame of the seat to the main frame, as well as attaching top and bottom parts of the seat frame to it. It is a HUGE pain to get apart in order to wash the cover (I\'m struggling right now) and a pain to get back together, but the fabric seat washes up well and although we\'ve had poopy leaks and banana mushed into it, we have yet to see any stains.Overall I would recommend this bouncer, but would much prefer if the headrest had some way of being attached and the seat was easier to get apart.",4
"2618","Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","First off, after doing EXTENSIVE research, and second guessing my last decision to buy this seat- I am VERY pleased that I did buy this instead of a Diono, Rocoro- or any other including the graco nautilus that was recommended to me sooo many times. (Although I refuse to buy another graco product EVER again anyway-)Love it!  The car seat IS easy to install, even though they changed the way you install from the old britax boulevard style seats.  The ""latch"" system straps are ok, but I do actually wish they left them able to be tightened independently-  however, we were still able to get a secure seating with the one side pull method.We got this seat in Maui Blue- and our 5 year old- almost 6 year old daughter loves it. She is small (very thin- not very tall) and she fits in this with very minor adjustment out of box. Headrest up a few notches, and we pulled the crotch buckle out to the middle position, because even though she is very tiny- even in the boulevard car seat, the crotch strap was TOO close to her for comfort. It would make the straps dig into her. (This was our reasoning for upgrading, even though she still fit height/weight requirements in her boulevard). The middle setting is a bit TOO large yet- but the smallest setting is just far too snug. I love the idea that the crotch strap can be moved- and even moreso, that the HARNESS weight limit is so HIGH!  We are extended rear facing parents- as well as extended forward facing harness lovers.. as it\'s just SAFER.  This seat seems to be built VERY sturdily, and we love that it\'s lower than the other britax seats- and easier for our daughter to get into on her own.  Overall- AMAZING seat. Love the cupholders, even though we don\'t allow eating or drinking while driving (for choking reasons) but when we\'re stopped somewhere, it\'s nice to have!  LOVE IT!  Will be purchasing that lap belt swap out in a few  years, to hold the lap belt into place when we do switch her over to the booster  settings without harness.Highly recommended, and it\'s worth the price by far.  We will be switching out our other 2 children\'s britax boulevards for these when the time comes!",NA
"2619","The First Years Hands Free Gate","We installed this gate (with the extension) in a 35"" opening, and it\'s worked fantastically for the last 9 months.  Our daughter is now 21-months-old, and continues to be blocked when needed.  Some details:Pros:- Very solid construction, with an easy to open foot mechanism.- The bars are positioned in such a way to keep little hands from getting caught when the gate is being opened or closed.  Our daughter loves to close the gate on us, and I cringed the first few times, but she\'s never gotten hurt or caught from it.- Easy to clean, and still looks fresh after many grabs with grubby hands!- I was also a bit concerned at first, because the opening has a baseboard that sticks out about 1/2"".  However, there was no problem installing it, and it\'s as strong as can be.Cons:- No negatives, except I wish this gate could be made in an extra-wide model.  We have another opening of 48"", and could never find a gate that really worked as well across such a wide gap.Overall, I highly recommend this to any parent.",5
"2620","Snuza Baby Monitor, Hero","We set up our room with an Arms Reach co-sleeper and and Angelcare motion mat before our son was born.

It\'s pretty much that way for any 6 foot gate.  I would shudder to think my child leaning hard on the middle of this thing .  On the outside portion of the gate, , I placed 2 4x12 inch retaining wall blocks, 1 on each side of the gate.  They are about 42 lbs each.  They provide plenty of additional stabilization for the gate and I\'m no longer worried about it collapsing. Good enough. I suppose you could add a wooden crossmember at the bottom instead, but this was the easiest and cheapest solution for me.",3

"2632","Peg-Perego 2011 Primo Viaggio Infant Car Seat, Pois Black","For the most part we really like this car seat. When our daughter was born the hospital actually required that we bring the car seat into the hospital for them to conduct a test with (they put the baby in it for an extended period of time and monitored her vitals)and the nurse actually commented on what a nice car seat it was. Our baby is now 11 weeks and so far so good. She does fuss when we initially put her in but I think that\'s just her being fussy and not necessarily her being uncomfortable because once she starts moving (whether in the car or in the Si stroller) she generally falls asleep, so she appears to be comfy.This is our first baby so therefor the first and only car seat we\'ve ever used so I can\'t do much of a comparison. However, one of the things that drew us to Peg Perego is the quality of the materials. We felt the plastic seemed much more durable then the Chicco and Graco ones.Our biggest complaint is that you need two hands to move the handle and even with two hands it sometimes doesn\'t want to cooperate and can be a bit challenging to move when the seat is in the car and you\'re leaning over it trying to push the button on the far side. I wish it had the release button at the top of the handle that can be pushed with just one hand. I also wish the canopy could be moved to other positions to adjust to where the sun is - it only covers the top part of the car seat.",4

One thing to note is that you can\'t push the seat straight down, because of the cover on the stroller.  You need to put the foot end of the car seat under the stroller cover, then click it down.  The adapter also comes with an added seat belt kind of clip for a little added piece of mind.",5

"2638","Jeep Liberty Renegade - Traditional Walker","I like the way it looks, but once you use it....you\'ll see the flaws...for one....the windshield comes off easily (or maybe my son is just too strong, either way...it shouldn\'t come off so easily)The horn on the wheel is a nice touch, truly a cute idea, especially the way the wheel is able to turn and play music, YET...the wheel comes off easily too! UGH!Walker is not good on carpet at all.Assembly was somewhat of a pain. Adjusting the walker to different heights (as your child grows) is another pain also, there has to be an easier way.The makers of this product should consider locking the windshield/wheel with some type of screw.It\'s really cute, too bad it has so many flaws!!!  If I could take it back, I would....I should have gone with a regular old-school walker....not like my son is going to be using it for much longer anyway. He\'ll be walking soon :)",3

The application was very quick and simple, the adhesive is holding pretty well. It is no longer remotely painful and the area is very well cushioned. The angles are very useful not only for the angles of the desk but I even applied one to the angel of the lower drawer and it is no longer a problem if my knee hits it.The color is off white and matches my beige table perfectly.Great product.

"2649","Blueberry Daytime Trainers Potty Training Pants (Large, Pink Noodles)","We got these trainers as an alternative to pull-ups for night time potty training with a 4 year old. I know, they are specified for daytime use, but our daughter is mostly ok at night. We really needed a ""safety net"" that would allow her to have occasional accidents at night, let her feel wet, and wake her up. This is not an alternative to a diaper. We got these trainers as an aid. The pull-ups (even the ones with the ""cool sensation"") just wicked away her pee so she could continue sleeping. These have done what we wanted and she almost always wakes up right away. We have only had one instance when she slept right through and the pee leaked out onto the sheets. I would imagine these trainers are great for daytime training. These would also work well with a potty alarm. While they can\'t potty train your child, they can help reduce the number of times you are washing sheets during the week and work great in conjunction with other methods.",5
"2650","Munchkin Arm &amp; Hammer Diaper Pail withRefill Bags, 10-Count","This is my first experience with a diaper pail, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I think this Munchkin Arm & Hammer is a good choice.The size is nice and slim. It can tuck easily away in a corner or side at the side of the changing table without taking up much space at all. It sets back nicely in correlation to the changing table. Its design and size does not scream out ""trash can"" or ""diaper pail.""It is easy to set up and easy to use. The lid closes securely to lock in odors. I do feel like a foot pedal for the lid would add a lot more convenience, though. It is a bit low, but I can over look that because I really wouldn\'t want something any more larger - it would look too much like a trash can then - kinda tacky - but that\'s just me being picky. I really like the current size because it doesn\'t draw attention in the baby\'s room.The bags fit in easily and are removed easily. Odors are contained. The baking soda addition to this diaper pail does help a bit to control the odor. The pail itself does not seem to retain any odors, which is a very good thing. Even plastic trash cans in the kitchen can retain odors after awhile, but I have not noticed that with this pail.It seems well made and I expect it to last for as long as it is needed - it feels solid and sturdy enough. Refills aren\'t too costly and the pail itself is a good price.Overall, I give it 5 stars. It does what it is supposed to, the price is fair and it fits in the nursery without being an eyesore.",5
"2651","Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","I have two children and I never used a sound machine with the first. However, my second child (10 months) is a very light sleeper and he was constantly waking up early from nap and having a hard time falling asleep at night. I couldn\'t stand having to tip toe around the house all the time and worry about every little noise my older daughter would make. This sound machine has worked exactly as I had hoped! I was a little weary at first about how loud the white noise was (you can control the volume, but I needed it loud to drown out the sounds in the house), but it didn\'t bother my son. After one or two uses, he was used to it. Every time I turn on the sound machine, he rubs his eyes and sucks his thumb. It\'s great that he knows it means bedtime!  Another happy surprise was that the sound machine actually helped my 3 year old daughter sleep in later too. They share a room, and my son usually wakes up first and he would wake her up with his fussing. Now, she sleeps through his fussing and doesn\'t wake up until an hour after him.  woohoo! I don\'t use the projector, but my daughter likes to turn out the lights in her room and play with it! Overall this is a great product and I am so glad I gave in and bought it!",5
"2652","Bumkins Waterproof Sleeved Bib - On-The-Go","Good quality, cute graphics, easily beats a regular bib for coverage over clothing. Minus one star because the neck size is too big, difficult to tie it small enough.

Not all stores have carts that fit 2 kids or they are unsafe due to broken belts such as the case in our local Target.  In the past my husband and I would each have a cart with a child in it which meant that one of us shopping with both kids was not an option.This product has been a lifesaver.  Installation is very easy and it looks well made.  I deducted 1 star from my rating because my toddlers sneakers get stuck on the leg holes when getting him in and out which can make it frustrating. I wish that it came in a solid color or at leasr a smaller pattern but this one is fine.",4

"2657","Itzy Ritzy Travel Happens Sealed Wet Bag, Avocado Damask","I bought this to use while traveling for wet swimsuits.  Typically I\'ve used the plastic laundry bags found in hotel closets, but they don\'t really seal the moisture in, sometimes resulting in leaks.  I thought this was perfect for my purposes.  It held 3 adult swimsuits (2 size small bikinis and 1 size small one-piece suit) comfortably and held the moisture in.  I had zero problems with moisture leaking out onto the other contents of my suitcase.  I also loved the Damask pattern.  It is very bright and vibrant and looks very stylish.  Overall, this is a great product.  It\'s done exactly what I need it to do and is a very versatile size - big enough that it holds more than one item comfortably, but small enough that I can stick it in a large purse or average size tote.  I also appreciate how durable it feels - the walls of the bag are much thicker than I expected.I\'d highly recommend this for anyone who wants to contain wet swimsuits while traveling.",5
"2658","Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature\'s Wonder","This seat was purchased on a whim, my 6 week old was being really fussy one day, and my husband and I went to the store to get him a infant tub to see if that would sooth him. Then we came across this seat, which I had seen before and fell in love with it and decided to get it for him. Thinking it would help sooth him, because he loves to be cradled and loves to vibrate and this seat does both. So when we got home and put him in it he loved it and it soothed him, he sleeps in it all the time. We even put it in his pack and play and it fits perfect in there. The blanket on it is nice and soft, the only thing is it falls off of him a lot so I swaddle him in a blanket when I put him in it. We love this seat, I just wish I would have gotten it when they added the mobile to it, because he would have loved that! So to me you can\'t go wrong purchasing this seat, cause it really helped out a fussy baby!",NA

This one by far was overall the best one.Here is what I looked for:1) Easy adjustments of height of the chair AND the chair back2) Sturdiness of the high chair3) Durability of the seat cushionThe Breeze was the best in all these areas.The chair back is easily to adjust, I believe it has 4 settings.The height was easy to adjust as well.The chair is a bit heavy, approx 26 lbs, but I was okay with this cause I wanted a high chair that will last a few years as the kid grows.The seat cushion is by far the best feature.  It is removable from the high chair itself, so we can throw it in the wash.Overall, I am very satisfied.",4

During the day I don\'t need it because I make the formula on demand.  Before we go to bed I make 2 bottles of formula and refrigerate it.  When our baby wakes for those 1 AM and 6 AM feedings, I grab a bottle out of the fridge, throw it in the warmer, grab the baby, change her, and when we are ready for that bottle, it is perfect!  Just the right temperature.  I use the Evenflo bottles with mine, which work great.  I, like the other buyers, have had to learn just how much water to add, but when you get it down pat, it works like a charm.  I highly recommend this unit.  It has simplified our lives and made those early feedings so much more pleasant.  Love this item.  It was well worth the purchase price and the convenience is worth that and more.",5

"2672","Lifefactory Glass Baby Bottle with Silicone Sleeve, Raspberry, 9 Ounce","We have tried many different types of bottle for our baby who is now 18 months.  LifeFactory is by far our favorite.  The person who had an unfortunate break must have dropped it at just the wrong spot on a very hard surface.  Our daughter has dropped/tossed/thrown the bottles on hardwood floors many times and they are as good as new.  We love using glass bottles since we know that it has no chemicals that will leach into the milk.  Dr Brown bottles are fine but these are more sturdy and lack the plastic inserts.  One good thing is that Dr. Brown\'s nipples fit perfectly in the LifeFactory caps.  We have not had a problem with the travel lids that I have read in other reviews.  You do need to make sure that they \'pop\' on so that they won\'t fall off. The silicon on the outside is not only fun and neat it also makes it really easy for a baby to hold on to and if the milk is warm, the silicon protects the baby\'s hand from the heat.

The other side has these fold down flaps, I\'m guessing for baby spoons, and that looks useful for me in the future.  I recommend that when the dishwasher cycle is done you pull it out and give it a good shake over the sink.

This unit is REALLY meant to be used as shown, that shape is the most stable.  If you do put two together the shape does not work out perfectly so we have used zip ties to attach the play yard to a railing to give it some extra stability.  If you have wood or laminate floors you MUST use the pads or the play yard will slide all over the room.This has allowed us to give my son some room to play and it keeps him safe if I have to answer the door or go to the bathroom.

"2698","philosophy Natural Nurturing  Baby Lotion","I love this stuff. I got it for DS\'s baby shower May 2011. It\'s a high quality cream, much more moisturizing than the usual baby lotion suspects.The lotion is such a high quality that you don\'t use much at all. I moisturize DS every other day and I\'ve had the lotion for about six months, maybe longer.The scent is lavendery enough to smell it, but not so much as to where it reminds you of your grandmother. DS has since associated the scent of the lotion with bedtime.My only complaint is that the bottle is not the best bottle for dispensing a creamy lotion and it gets warped after a while.Like I said, I\'ve used this stuff for 2 YEARS and I am never going back. I\'m on here right now to order more before they run out.",5

"2702","Learning Curve True Fit Convertible Car Seat, Pink Butterfly","After getting into a small side impact collision, my insurance company send me a check to replace my car seat in case there was some damage as a result of the accident.I looked online and at other local retailers for days.The problem with all the other car seats is that they are really cheaply made and offer zero cushion comfort for your baby.The True Fit C650 is very well made , very confortable padding, easy to clean you just take the shell out and put it in the washer.The best part is that the seat is very easy to use. If you have seat latches in your car it should take no more that 5 minutes,Cons.The lower seat buckle can pinch your kids leg if you dont put it on carefully.",5

I\'ve been using this for 10 mos now and both support rods at the top of the hamper have poked through the material and have fallen out.

"2707","RECARO Performance BOOSTER High Back Booster Car Seat, Vibe","When I received this, I thought it was an actual carseat and not just a Booster so it was my fault as it clearly says BOOSTER in the description.  Where I was thrown off was where it said minimum weight recommendation was 30 pounds.  My son is 40 pounds but he is only 3.5 years old.  Obviously he needs a harness and this does not have one.Being a booster it uses the existing seatbelt and performs exactly as it says, &#34;Boosting&#34; the person in the seat higher up.  My son felt it was very comfortable and we had several long car rides and it certainly seems as if it would be.  Also, I like the head protection on both sides that seems very solid.  Of great interest that my son loved was that it has 2 cup holders-one on each side.  Great for juice and water or milk.  It is easy to clean and mixes with most car interiors.  Also, it is reasonably light so it would be easy for a small woman to put in a car and remove on a consistent basis.A very solid booster that is comfortable with all the conveniences your little one will need.  Love the head protection!",4

"2709","Combi Chopsticks Training Set","I bought these training chopsticks when my son was two years old.  He was able to pick up food and eat with them on the very first try.  The orange plastic guide piece ensures that the chopsticks are held in the proper position, making the chopsticks an extension of your child\'s own fingers.  I didn\'t even have to explain how to use them!  Now, my son (not Chinese, and only asked to use chopsticks occasionally)is seven years old and prefers loose chopsticks like the grown-ups use.  I credit the fact that he can do this to the Combi trainers.  I\'ve subsequently bought these for his cousins as well.Our two pair have held up very well - no signs of wear.  I put them in the top rack of the dishwasher, which is great.  You can remove the guide piece for an intermediate level trainer, but the guide had taught him well enough that we went straight from that to adult chopsticks.It is rare that you find a product that is well designed and actually does what it advertises.  The Combi trainer chopsticks are definitely one of those rare gems.",5

"2715","Chicco Little Driver Baby Walker","We purchased this walker for our then-7 month old so he could start strengthening his legs a bit more, and within a few weeks he is now taking real steps in it! The whole theme of this walker is terrific- the sounds aren\'t annoying and we love the option of animal sounds vs. music. He has become great at turning the key to change these modes, beeping the horn, and pressing the buttons. He seems very comfortable in it and it\'s easy to change the height. We use it on our kitchen floor because most of the house is carpeted, unfortunately. That\'s why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars- the only drawback to this walker is if you have carpet- it does not slide very well because the brake pads catch on the carpet. I could try taking them off I suppose to see if it glides more on carpet without the pads. And maybe when he has more walking skills he will be able to move more efficiently on carpet because it does require a lot more work! I could see the walker being outstanding though in a floored home where the baby could cruise the length of whole rooms!  :)",4

So you can only monitor you child for the first 10 minutes you\'re asleep.Additionally, the app for iOS was non-functional for at least a week before being fixed by Summer. Their terms of service specifically state that they are not responsible for outages. Again, this makes the product useless as a baby monitor.",1

"2724","Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","I was worried about getting a walker because I knew they were seen as dangerous.  But after reading up...the main problem is that babies fall down stairs in them.  I don\'t have stairs so no fear there.  There are also issues with babies hips and learning to walk eventually.  I just make sure he\'s not in it everyday and he\'s not in it all day.  It\'s nice to have though for those times he needs to be a little contained for his safety.  He flys in it.  He does like to crash in to everything (on purpose and not) so make sure you\'re prepared for that.  We first had it when we had carpets which they don\'t really move on but now we have all tile.  I figure if you don\'t have stairs and you\'re a good parent and don\'t think a toy babysits your kid then it\'s great.",5

I\'ve never seen this before and I can\'t believe I never thought to do this myself!  My 22 month old son LOVES to point out the different characters to me as we read books before bed.  Anything to distract Mommy into staying longer...Would totally buy this again.",5
"2734","Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","My only problem with this booster seat is that it will not work beyond the point when the trays are removed and it becomes just a booster seat. My table top is at the standard height, but the skirt of the table goes down too far to allow the seat to go under the skirt area. The booster does strip snugly to both dining room and kitchen chairs so there is no safety issues. The top sections of the tray are no longer used as a child can take them off too easily so I just utilize the bottom tray. It is a very economical way to have a high chair equivalency that works well and I would recommend this item for that purpose. It will also work well with a table that does not have a skirt to block it from scooting up to your table.",4

I have not had any of the problems that others have listed here - I hang it up in the tub to drain overnight and have not seen any mildew at all.  Best of all, I can use it as a back cushion for myself in the tub!!  Overall, I highly recommend this for any parent who wants to avoid using a smaller tub or seat.",5

This fit my graco pack n\'play perfectly and I was even able to use it with the fitted sheet I had bough for the graco. I am sure the fitted sheet that you can purchase separately for this item would fit better but mine was just fine. I am very pleased with this purchase.

"2753","Kel-Gar Pinwheel Fan","I do use this a lot during the warmer months, but it doesn\'t do a lot if your stroller is a very open type.  I clip this on the shade of one of my strollers that surrounds my child more, to keep the air moving in there, and it seems to work fine for that.I do keep extra batteries and a small screwdrive in the stroller because when they start to get a little weak, the fan is useless for moving air.

I didn\'t use it as much as I thought because I prefered having her in the stroller or carrier in shopping cart when we went out because it gets too heavy for long periods of wear. You will use it much more when baby is small. I only used it around the house and now that she is 5 months she is way too heavy for me. For a person of larger stature, it would work great, though.I am only 5 ft tall, and it sizes nicely down to fit me. It does fit my husband (almost 6 ft and 175 lbs), but barely. If Daddy is going to wear it you\'ll probably need the XL straps.",4

It was so much like my breast it made switching between the 2 much easier.  But now he drinks formula all the time about 8oz at a time and it is crazy that at 4:00 in the morning I have to stop everything to change him and that makes him even more upset! I know how to screw the top on and I think it is crazy that you have to pay almost $5.00 a bottle and that you have to go through all these things to stop them from leaking!  He also has acid reflux and I thought this would be a great bottle to help with that.  Now I am learning from my mistakes! Were trying to get him to accept a new bottle and it is so hard because the avent bottles is all he wants now! I don\'t care what anyone says don\'t use these bottles unless you want more milk on you and your baby than in the bottle! It\'s crazy they should fix the problem and it\'s their problem to fix not the parents!! Come on now $5.00 a bottle!

But other than that, I am very pleased, my 4-year old can easily scoop/fish all the toys up as a game, and then I rinse them off and hang back up.

The Car seat easily latches into the stroller and locks at both the front and the back of the seat.  There are several adjustments on the stroller for a full recline to removable tray for baby.  The storage compartment is very roomy and folds down for easy access when seat is fully reclined.  The pattern for this system is great could definately be for a girl or boy, with a more modern pattern.  Fabric is easily wipeable while still be soft and comfortable.  I love the base for the car seat.  its kind of tricky to get latched into the car, but once in is super convenient and easy to use.  The car seat also allows for standard seat belt to cross over the top of the car seat and strap in for easy use in vehicles without the base.  Definately think we made the right choice.  I\'m at 7 months and can see us using this system for years to come.",5
"2772","Inglesina Fast Table Chair, Blu Notte","I\'ve gotten so much use out of this chair over the past 8 months.  I take my one-year-old out to eat at least once a week and this chair is perfect at restaurants.  I always ask for a booth and then slide the chair in next to me and it works great.  I also use it in my kitchen - we have a breakfast bar at the kitchen counter and my baby likes to sit there in his Inglesina while we cook.  I can\'t say how it will be once my baby starts wanting to walk around.  But for now, it\'s perfect!",5

"2776","Kalencom On the Go Potty, Blue","I just received this ""Potette portable potty"" and I\'m kicking myself for not noticing that this is NOT the one that you can use on regular toilets!  I guess I will keep this in our van, but now I have to order the ""2-in-1"" potty, which has legs that fold out to hold it on big toilets.  I wish that I had noticed the difference when I was looking at these.  If you are looking for a seat that works with your toilet, this is NOT it.  That being said, it seems like it will work for emergencies and travel needs, though it is TINY.  The kids in the pictures look like they\'re sitting on the ground.  Also, the carrying bag that comes with this is just a plastic bag (maybe a bit heavier than a Ziploc bag) with a drawstring; not sure how long it will last.",3
"2777","Orbit Baby G3 Stroller Frame, Black","I paired this frame with theOrbit Baby G3 Stroller Seat, Black. This frame is SOLID. It arrives mostly assembled (as did the seat I ordered) and I had the system together and ready to roll in under ten minutes.This stroller system provides an extremely smooth ride and is easy and comfortable to push and turn. I love that this system allows me to easily turn baby from forward to rear facing. Sometimes my little guy likes to face forward and people watch; other times it\'s nice to have him face me, especially if he is overstimulated and/or tired.The frame folds up easily and is lightweight. I have no trouble lifting and fitting it into the trunk of my mid-sized sedan.Overall I\'ve been extremely pleased with this product. If you can get past the initial sticker shock and are willing to invest in a quality stroller setup, I highly recommend this system.",5

"2780","Joovy Groove Umbrella Stroller, Greenie","This stroller was beautiful and so perfect for me as a parent. But all three of my children (ages, 1, 2, and 4) hated it because the seat is at the wrong angle and they all slid forward against the crotch buckle. This was a combination of a seat back that doesn\'t sit fully upright and a seat bottom that was angled too flat and was too &#34;shallow&#34; from the back of the seat to the knee measurement. This also pushes the older child\'s knees out to the point where it was very tricky for her to keep her feet on the footrest. She kept dangling her feet in front of the wheels.**Ultimately, as much as I loved the handle height (I\'m 5\'8 and it was great height for me or taller), easy recline, parent pocket and cup holders, wheels, etc. if my child is miserable, I will be miserable. Back into the box it went:(Incidentally, I ordered the Inglesina Trip and the seat was much better for the kiddos, had a flatter recline (though not quite as easy but ok), easier wheel locks, more compact fold, lighter weight, easier canopy, etc.",2

I originally bought this for one of our new babies, but we\'re giving it to the toddler because it\'s pretty soft even though I\'m worried that she\'s going to destroy it by jumping on it. It was tough to get sheets on because it kept wanting to fold thanks to the tight sheets!Would I buy it again? Maybe. Hopefully it will get our toddler through her toddler bed and into a real bed.

"2792","Under The Nile Under The NileBurp Cloths, White, 4-Count","While a lot of people will tell you can just use a kitchen towel, and they would be right, this is definitely better. The organic cotton is soft and durable. It has held up fabulously under repeated washings (had mine for 7 months now) and they appear to be somewhat stain resistant. They are long (like a dish towel) which is great when baby spits up over your shoulder, since it catches it for a distance. Also, they are 2-ply in their construction, which also helps in terms of not allowing the mess to soak through easily, which was a life-saver on many occasions. As a result, I would highly recommend these burp cloths. I absolutely love them!",5

The hat makes crinkly noises, the rings clack together, the ball rattles, there are plenty of legs to chew on, and theres even a little mirror hidden on his underside. I know it says surface wash but we have tossed it in the wash in a lingerie bag on gentle cycle and even dried it on low for a little while and it came out good as new.",5

With the natural shape nipples coming out, Dad feeds him formula before bed and I have some freedom! Alex is happy because of no air in his belly, Mom can go out and Dad gets to bond with him -we are happy!It\'s 2007 and our second baby has used the same bottles!

It took me a couple hours but I cut out each piece individually and taped to the wall to see how I wanted it. When that was done I just peeled the back off and stuck it on. I have to say the quality of the decal exceeds my expectations and would consider buying from this company in the future. Only thing was there was no picture included so I just printed the one off here as a sort of template. :)",4

I couldn\'t decide whether to bite the bullet and purchase a Medela Pump in Style or this one. I have had an electric pump in the past (First Years Dual Pump) and really didn\'t care for it - it was so noisy, at times wouldn\'t have great suction, as ws awkward to handle while breastfeeding my baby on one side. I felt like I was constantly prisoner to the electric outlet sine I couldn\'t move anywhere since it was so comlicated to get everything together.This pump was quiet, fast (8 ounces in under 15 minutes from both breasts) and needed no electric outlet. At first I was afraid my hand would get sore, but no problem at all. I had better luck w/out the petal cushion - this just didn\'t work for me, and I\'ve never had a problem stimulating letdown without it.I am so glad I didn\'t purchase a PIS, I also love the bottles, they\'re the only kind my baby will use!",5

"2816","Aden by aden + anais Muslin Sleeping Bag, Oh Boy, Small","I was hesitant to buy this based on reviews about rips and the zipper breaking, but we\'ve had this in heavy rotation for almost four months and have no complaints! It\'s true the zipper is cheaper than most others (plastic) but this hasn\'t caused any problems for us.It is so soft, and has gotten even softer with washing. The mod turtle print is cute - a good gender neutral option. Size medium says 6-12 months, 15-24 lbs / 7-11 kg. My daughter has been wearing this since she was 7 months, 18lbs and is now 11 months and about 20.5 lbs and it fits very comfortably. I think she will outgrow the length first, but that seems to be the case with every sleesack (and all sleepers and onesies too).Even though I bought it for summer I think we\'ll actually be able to keep using it this fall and maybe into winter since fleece sleepers aren\'t quite warm enough here (Minnesota) by themselves (well, depending on the kid and house) but it\'s too much to layer them with heavier sleepsacks. We\'ve been using this over her regular clothes a lot for naps too and I think that will continue to work at least through the fall. This summer we used this sleepsack with just a onesie at naps or a lightweight cotton sleeper at night.",5

"2819","Philips AVENT Soothie Pacifier, 0-3 Months, 2-Pack, Pink/Purple","When my fourth was born and would not take any of the pacifiers I had on hand, I went to the store and bought one of every kind of pacifier I could find. I gave them to her one by one, hoping that she would take ONE of them, leaving Soothie for last, even after the knock-off gum drops or whatever they\'re called. I don\'t care for the way they look or the weird nub looking thing on the backside of them, meant for a pacifier clip or something I suppose.As a last resort, I gave her the Soothie brand.  She didn\'t take to it right away, but she didn\'t immediately spit it out like she had many of the others. Eventually she grew to like it and accept it and for that I am grateful. However it appears to be a magnet for every piece of hair, fur, and lint that comes it\'s way. I am forever washing the dang thing off, far more often than would be necessary for basic sanitation were it not a fuzz magnet. I have used various other brands and types with my previous children, and none of them had this issue. Of course there was a stray hair here and there that would make it\'s way, especially if it was freshly spit out and promptly dropped on the floor, but not to the extent that these do. If your child is willing to accept a different brand and there are no concerns with breastfeeding, then try a different brand.",3
"2820","My Little Seat Infant Travel High Chair, Colored Stripes","I recently took a trip to Los Angeles and wanted to bring something with me for my 5 month old that was compact, lightweight, and easy to use.  I bought the 6 month and older size (since the other was sold out).  This is definitely compact and lightweight, but was slightly confusing to put together.  There are so many snaps, buckles, ties, that you can fashion something workable no matter how you use it.  I imagine that the amount of closures is to make it as adaptable as possible to various seats, which is a good thing, but it can just be frustrating.  The ties are also very long, so it drags on the dirty restaurant floor.  It does fold together very well though, and it is easy to fold up and put back in its small pouch, which fits easily in a diaper bag or purse.Some things to keep in mind:High backed chairs - If it is too high, the slip that goes over the top will make the bottom too high to sit on the chair itself.  We have fairly high backed chairs in our dining room, where we first tested it out, and my daughter probably would have been more comfortable with a phone book underneath her.  Also, the buckles that go over the shoulders at the chest were more around her ears.Chairs with backs that don\'t come very close to the seat - You\'ll have to creatively fashion the ties so that your baby won\'t slip through the back, but it\'s possible/workable.  I just didn\'t realize that at first, so it was a scary moment until I caught her!Restaurant Booths - We wanted it to use as a travel high chair for restaurants, since my daughter isn\'t big enough for a standard high chair yet.  Unfortunately, I found that many restaurants we went into only had booths available, rendering the whole thing useless.In the end, I\'m glad I had it with me, but we only used it maybe 2 times in the 5 days we were there.  It works as described, but I\'m not sure if it was worth it for this particular trip.  We\'ll keep it around and as she gets a little older, it might be nice to have when just going around town to restaurants or traveling to family\'s homes.",3

Our previous monitor had such a short battery life because it was active all the time. Also, it has noise cancellation.

"2826","Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary","I bought this cup for my son because of the non-leaching plastic.  He already has a Klean Kanteen sippy cup (which works great!), but I decided to give the Born Free drinking cup a try. The cup is easy to clean and easy for a small child to hold.  After reading the reviews, I knew that I was purchasing a ""drinking cup"" which can leak, instead of the Born Free sippy cup version with a non-leaking spout.  I thought it might teach my 14 month-old how to handle a cup more carefully, and in many ways it has helped him learn that he needs to keep the cup upright. My only complaint about this cup is that after a couple days of use (and some biting on the soft spout) the flow hole became larger causing MUCH more spillage than when the cup was brand new.  We now have to be VERY careful that this cup is kept upright at all times or the result is a large puddle on the floor or wet spot on my son\'s clothes.  Overall, it\'s a good option for a safe toddler cup, and it\'s less expensive than the Klean Kanteen or the Sigg.",4

I LOVE it.Before this pad, I was using liners that had a plasticky synthetic layer on the bottom, and soft organic terrycloth on the top. Unfortunately, those liners got more and more warped with each wash, until they were so curled up I could not use them anymore. But this liner is all cotton, and it is thick and sturdy yet very soft. Liquid doesn\'t leak through to the changing table cushion unless I leave it there for a very long time.And best of all, it doesn\'t warp in the wash. It still lies beautifully flat. And the canvas-y material helps it cling to the changing table cushion, so it doesn\'t catch my son\'s attention and make him want to roll over and play with it mid-change.I only wish it were a little cheaper so I could buy 3 or 4 more!",5

That was remedied with an apology over the two way talk feature. Then the two way talk feature stopped working. It came back briefly, but when it stopped again we took it back.",3

"2841","Baby Einstein Octoplush","I am a polyglot and my son is learning three languages at present, he is 13 months learning Spanish, Dutch and English, and I really liked the fact this is in French, Spanish and English. My son has not really got into this the same way he likes other Baby Einstein products but I think he will as he gets older (he is 13 months now). The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because I think language is important and the icing on the cake would have been the ability to choose three or more languages. I know it is not created for the &#34;multilingual&#34; families but rather for the fact that Canadians need French and Americans need Spanish (both because there are large populations in the two countries of those languages respectively, and because as Canada is a bilingual French/English country, USA is increasingly bilingual Spanish/English), but still considering they probably sell this toy all over the world it would be great to be able to choose your languages.",4

The handles are long so I don\'t have to hunch over anymore as I did with my umbrella stroller.  The recline feature is also good.  It allows my son to sleep comfortably rather than falling to the front while asleep.  The basket is also nice.  The only reason I gave it 4 star because sometimes the wheels tend to get twisted around and get stuck while being on rough sidewalks.  Other than that, I really like this stroller.",4

I\'ve gone a few nights without it (went out of town and pillow too big to bring along), and boy, did I feel the difference.  It provides great support for the back and belly.  My daughter loves it too.  I plan to continue using it even after delivery.  Absolutely recommend.I\'ve noticed another comment on the coarseness of the cover fabric.  I think it may be a problem if your skin is really sensitive.  Mine is not sensitive so I find the cover fabric to be just fine.  But if yours is, then maybe you should check out other covers sold at Babies R Us.  I am not sure about the texture variation, but I know that my local Babies R Us carry them in several different colors/designs.  If you are having problems with your sleep or have back or belly discomfort, you should definitely give this pillow a try.As for price, it is a little high compared to a regular pillow, but for a pregnancy pillow, I think it is not bad at all.  I\'ve tried the Bobby Total body pillow before this, and I can tell you, it costs just as much (or slightly more), and does not come with a cover.  Also, it is not as nearly as comfortable or versatile as the Leachco Snoogle total body pillow.  For me, it really comes down to either paying $5x for this one pillow, or $1x each for 5 standard pillows (which will probably cost just as much or more, will take up more room on the bed, and will require much re-arranging when shifting around during sleep).",5

"2861","Britax Boulevard 65 TSIP Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","Pros - This car seat is very easy to use (the adjustable headrest is very convenient). Some have complained about how hard it is to pull the straps tight, but I have found that you can ratchet it tighter by pulling on the tightening strap without much effort several times. This seat is very comfortable, our 7th month old loves it. It is also fully loaded with safety features. Overall a high-end seat!Cons - it has a bigger footprint than other seats and requires a good deal of room in our back seat. Fortunately we have an SUV, but it is a small one, so while their is enough room between the front and back seats, getting to the seatbelts next to the car seat is quite difficult because of its width. Also, the seat is quite expensive. We purchased a model with fabric from last year on clearance and that brought the price down closer to the Marathon. The biggest difference between the two models seems to be the TSIP system - and for us it wasn\'t a straight forward call (they always want to get us parents to feel guilty for not having the ""safest"" items for our kids, don\'t they!) In the end, it was the price that made it worth it for us.",4

"2871","Graco Ready2Grow Classic Connect LX Stroller, Metropolis","I read a lot of reviews on doubles, because I was afraid of having to drive a limo around with two kids in it.  However, this one really fits the bill.  A lot of reviewers said it\'s just a beast, and that it\'s too big.  Well, let me tell you something.  It\'s made to hold two kids, it\'s a double stroller.  It\'s going to be a beast.  But, it\'s not THAT much bigger than a single stroller, so I\'m pleased.  Also, yeah, folded up, it\'s pretty big.  Again, I\'m not sure what else you would expect from a double stroller, unless you get a side by side umbrella.  It folds one-handed, and (this one\'s a biggie) it STEERS one-handed! I was expecting something like those stupid car carts at the grocery store, you know, the ones that you have to make 5-point turns with?  No, this drives like a dream.  I also love that I can put my kinds in it some many different ways.  I have an almost 2 year old and a baby coming in July.  The 2 year old fits just fine in the front with the car seat in the back, or he can even sit in the jump seat while the car seat sits in the front.  It\'s wonderful.  I love this thing, and it\'s exactly what I was looking for in a double stroller!  Highly recommend!",5

"2874","Sunshine Kids See Me Rear View Mirror, Black","This is a very good product.  I drive a Volvo SUV and most of rear view mirrors (that attach to the windscreen instead of the rear view mirror) are not able to give me any view of my baby\'s car seat.  I reckon it is because of the slope of the SUV front windscreen, compared to sedans, and the poor rotating angle of most mirrors.The other thing that I love about this product is the magnifying ability of the mirror.  A few other reviewers had commented negatively on this aspect.  I am able to see my baby\'s entire face and upper body, not just the eyes, as one reviewer claimed!  Either the reviewer had an extremely small car, or extremely big kid!The only reason why I had to purchase this product for the second time was because the rubber on the suction cup melted away after 1.5 years of usage. Considering I park (without any shade) under sweltering tropical temperatures of more than 30 degree Celsius (not Fahrenheit!) for more than 300 days in a year, I was surprised it even lasted beyond a year!The last thumbs up - it is so lightweight that even if the mirror does fly off, as others claim, it will not hurt your child.

We keep the stabilizers down so that it can\'t rock, but eventually she\'ll want to let it rock. She also loves the toy bar, but unfortunately, since the toys are built in they don\'t come out and she would love to get them to her mouth - but they just don\'t reach. One bad thing about it is that the fabric doesn\'t ""bounce back"" after it\'s been on the flattest position for awhile. We have a chunky baby, so that may play into it, but the fabric is all loose and bunched up where she stretched it out. The construction is sturdy and the belt harness doesn\'t bother our baby.

"2894","The First Years Indigo Stroller, Red","If i had a chance to do everything over again i would have registered for this and a chicco car seat and skipped the ""travel system."" I HATE my graco travel system! while it may have a cute print (and the carseat has a huge canopy that i love) it is heavy and bulky all around. i drive a two door honda and i can barely fit my graco stroller in my trunk. besides that it drives like crap unless you are on perfectly smooth pavement and it is super hard to steer on handed so if i have to answer my phone or take a sip of water i have to stop walking completely. i was desperate for a new stroller but i wanted to be able to still snap my car seat into it. i did some research and found this! first and foremost it is a fraction of the price of other strollers that offer the same features. second it comes with the car seat adapter!!!! amazing! more companies need to include an adapter with the stroller! however even though i love this stroller it is definately not for everyone and there is some room for improvement which is why i gave it only four stars. so i\'ll list my pros and cons...PROS: The frame is very light weight and folds completely in half so it fits in a small trunk and still gives you room for other things like groceries.easy to steer one handed, and while its not built for rough terrain it does quite well on my crappy sidewalks (i live in the northeast all our roads n sidewalks are bad)car seat adapter fits both graco and chicco infant car seats, and probably more its very universal.the seat is so adjustable! can be laid back almost flat for a sleepy newborn or sitting up for older babies, you can also adjust the foot rest part of the seat which keeps legs from dangling which can be uncomfortable esp for chunkier babies. my baby loves that i can put the foot rest out horizontally for her.for the price it looks very nice!!! i expected a bit of a cheaper look but its very cute! i got the red and its so vibrant, i really love it!it is simple to install the seat or car seat adapter and easy to put the car seat in. i had to struggle with my graco to get her huge car seat into the stroller and they are matching pieces of a travel system!CONS: lets just say this is not meant for people who live in a walkup or are constantly on and off public transport. you need two hands to collapse it as you can not do so with the adapter attached or the seat. for me this isnt a big deal but if i lived in an apartment building i could not deal with this stroller!the wheels squeek like crazy! it started our first trip out just a little bit not enough to be annoying. now its pretty much constant and my husband has got to put some lubricant on the wheels (many other reviewers have used WD-40 some with success some without but WD-40 is not intended to be used as a lubricant go to your local hardware supplier and ask what would work best if you are unsure) the company really should fix this however, it\'s an obvious design flaw that many people have complained about.the canopy on the stroller is pretty small. i have found this on many other strollers that i didnt like as much as this one, and if i had paid for a more expensive model and it had a short canopy i\'d be pissed but because this wasnt that expensive its no big deal to buy a parasol or extender for it.So hopefully this helps you decide which stroller is best for you. the only thing i cant speak to is how it handles in winter but i try not to use my stroller in the snow because the road salt causes them to rust. my graco only came out in the bad weather a few times and its all rusted on bottom!!!!",NA

So far- as long as I make sure to turn the lock on (turning it to the proper position) we do not have any difficulties with keeping her from opening the oven door.My only complaint is that it is a bit too big for the area on the front of our oven that we put it but I\'m sure it fits better on different ovens than ours.",4

However, today we tried to turn it into the activity table. It does not work safely! It is very wobbly and the legs of the table are so far from the end of the table that it will most certainly collapse under the weight of a toddler puling up on it. I am really bummed because we registered for this product believing that it would grow with our child. Step 3 does not work!!! If you are set on the activity table part of it look for another product. My husband is putting the excersaucer back together as I type. At least our son can walk around the saucer safely and not have the threat of it falling while he is playing.",3

"2911","Summer Infant 3 Stage Newborn to Toddler Baby Bath, Monkey Moons","I have read another review that they never used the sling option because it was too high above the water. But I use it specifically for this purpose. I took home a preemie who was sponge bathed in the NICU for a month. He was tiny when he was born but still tiny when he came home just over 4lbs.The sling works great because he is not sitting in the dirty water. I can use it right next to the sink and rinse him off well with this sling. I have used this sling for almost 5 months and it is just like new. I have tried out the tub without the sling for just warm soaks but will probably change to a less slippery tub when he can sit up on his own (yes he is delayed a little). Over all I love this tub, its simple, easy to clean, sturdy, and no leaks. Can\'t say anything negative about it personally because it has lasted longer than I intended. And for the price I would buy a second one if it hadn\'t lasted as long.",5

At a restaurant I just grab the changer and the baby and we are off without lugging the whole diaper bag.

"2917","Mountain Buggy 2013 Terrain Stroller (Flint)","I went on my first run with the 2013 Mountain Buggy terrain this morning. So far, I am disappointed. I was running on a smooth road and the stroller would pull extremely to the right side with front wheel in a fixed position. I had to correct the direction constantly by pushing down the handlebar on one side. Needless to say that my shoulders hurt quite a bit now. I checked the front wheel and found that 1) it is impossible to fix the wheel in a way so it is not tilted and 2) the front wheel has to much wiggle room and will automatically turn to the right when I start pushing the stroller.The second thing that I noticed is the discomfort the cover of the handle bar causes. I don\'t why they chose this kind of material. It seems cheap, feels like plastic, doesn\'t seem to absorb sweat and most importantly they hurt my hands. Not what I would have expected when I ordered a 500 dollar stroller.Will talk to customer service next and give update.",NA

We have enlongated bowls, and it still fits very securely. With a small step stool, she has had no problems using it. We have a kid-height hook in her bathroom (originally for a towel) that she hangs the seat on when she is done ... useful for multi-people toilets! Except for an occasional adjustment and cleaning, the seat is \'no maintainance.\' I love that I\'ve never had to clean a separate potty bowl, and she loves that she uses a big potty just like mommy!",NA

We\'re using the same two with our 2nd child and I have been able to get much better sleep earlier (knowledge is power).  Other reviewers have complained about their children wriggling out which occassionally happens, but I found that if I put them to sleep in long sleeves, they have a harder time getting out.  Also, I had to use the conventional swaddling method until my 2nd child weighed about 10 pounds--I couldn\'t wrap the swaddleme tight enough until then.  I have not had a problem with my children pulling the velcro apart, but I\'m very careful about aligning the velcro when wrapping the child.  Note:  The fleece is very thin, not thick like a sweatshirt, and it is quite stretchy.  You don\'t have to worry about your child overheating.",5

It has been through the wash a couple times now on a regular cycle with the rest of her baby clothes.  I hang it up to let it dry, I don\'t throw it in the dryer.  So far, it seems to be holding up just fine.  Materials and workmanship seem to be quality.  It\'s not one of her favorites, but I think that\'s more of a personal choice and it could be great for another baby.",4

Did I mention I was traveling alone with a 6 month old from Italy to the Northwest?  So far I have stuffed approximately 22 diapers, a travel boppy, a medium wipes case, a change of clothes for me (work out pants, t-shirt and undies) and two sleepers for my baby, and it STILL has room!  It comes with a pocket for a hydration bag, but since I cannot use this during travel, I put 16 size 3 diapers in it, I put the other 6 size 3 diapers in the front fold compartment made for them to be stored.  It is about the size as a regular military backpack (if you know what size that it is). It has one large main compartment with two Velcro pockets on the inside as well as that hydration pack pocket.  I am so excited to use this bag.  I would not recommend using it to travel overseas for security reasons, but in the states I would be comfortable using it.  Hope that helps.  I will update this and let you know how much I can actually fit in it!  The only two cons I see, which are not that bad is the velcro closures can be hard to open, but I like this and I wish it could come in a more discreet color so it could be used comfortably overseas.

"2942","Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Polypropylene Bottle, Opaque, 4 Ounce, 2 Pack","we got the BPA-free, yellow-tinted avent bottles as a gift. like 50% of the reviewers said, they leaked like crazy (both 9-oz and 4-oz), and we wasted a lot of precious breast milk. i was really disappointed and upset, b/c the bottles were made of good quality plastic. however, if 50% of the bottles leak, then it is simply a design flaw, and should be removed from the shelves. we called avent and they sent us the new polypropylene bottles to try out. these work great! they don\'t leak at all, as long as the adapter ring is put on properly (and no need to make it too tight). since it\'s just one extra piece and relatively easy to clean, i have no problem w/ this design. another thing i like about the avent bottles is that the measurement print is large and easy to read. however, one thing to note is that on some of the polypropylene bottles, the paint comes off after washing a few times. i have three 4-oz bottles w/ no problem, but on two of my four 9-oz bottles (which were bought later), almost all of the paint has been rubbed off due to washing.  i guess this is a hit and miss situation. thus the four star rating.we also tried dr. brown bottle. at first i liked it, b/c it was leak-proof, and prevented air bubbles going through the nipple. but so many parts! (so many small parts too). i pump exclusively, so the extra cleaning of the parts was too much. the avent bottle also does a great job at keeping gas out of the baby. plus, i like the wide bottle design, b/c it\'s easier to get in there and clean it thoroughly. we also tried playtex drop-ins, i\'m not crazy about these, b/c the air still gets in there, and the drop-ins sometimes will break after heating in a bottle warmer. the only advantage i can think of is to use on a trip for the convenient factor.",4

"2957","Mountain Buggy Urban Single Stroller - Navy","bought this stroller three years ago.  now that we have two children i am looking at the double.  i LOVE my mountain buggy.  we lived in down town chicago for the first two years we had this stroller.  we could walk to everything we needed so we didn\'t even keep our car in the city so i used this stroller everyday for everything.  i abused and misused it and it still held up great.  for instance the roomy under storage combined with the shopping bag strap near the handle bar held groceries for a family of four at least once a week for two years i\'m positive i surpassed the weight limit many times.  when i wasn\'t carting aroun my shopping it very easily held all baby supplies and frequently family picnic lunches.i liked the wobble suspension it\'s means going on rough terrain is much more comfortable for baby. also nice when they are fussy, you can jiggle the stroller a bit as your walking to sooth them.  after three years of almost daily use of at two to three miles per day the wheels have started to wear but have not needed to replace yet.  i just occasionally pump them up with small hand pump that comes with the stroller.  i\'ve used it jumping city curbs and jogging on paved and unpaved routes, although it\'s not an extreme all terrain stroller a well used woodland path is fine.i didn\'t have a problem with it being too big as some people have said.  it\'s a bigger stroller bit i was never limited on where i could go even shopping in little boutiques or at crowded festivals.  the only thing i didn\'t like to do by myself is try to get on the bus.  you can\'t lift this safely by yourself with a baby in it.style and function could not be beat by any other brand i saw.  i was part of a mom\'s group s i got to com[pare with lots of other strollers.  a bugaboo for instance is fine if you stay on smooth sidewalks or are in a mall not walking in a city.  the bob is an athletic performance stroller but it\'s ugly!  the ""BOB""  logo can be seen from every angle because it\'s on there like six times.  my buggy is sleek and stylish and doesn\'t flash a brand which i like.the recline feature is great it goes virtually flat so even a very young baby can use it and my daughter slept very well in it. easy to do i\'ve even done it without stopping our walk.  the brake is handy and reliable the safety strap is a must.  just slips on your wrist.  it folds up smoothly after practicing once or twice and is very easy to unfold.  it fit easily in the trunk of a two door honda civic.i got the plastic rain cover which i think is a must if you will use it in the cold.  chicago gets very cold and i was worried about getting out to do errands with my baby girl but a snuggly stroller bag and the rain cover kept her cozy in any weather even a february blizzard.my only complaint and it\'s something that the bob beats it on i hate to say, is that the sun shade should be bigger.  i did have to use a blanket over the front certain times of day a bit of a pain.  but i really do love this stroller lots of fond memories exploring chicago just me my daughter and our trusty mountain buggy.",5

It\'s a great exerciser for balance and for them to learn to use their little feet to propel themselves forward. The other thing they seem to love about it is that it allows them to see a little more of what\'s going on around the room. It is unfortunately rather expensive (though it\'s cheaper if you order it directly from their website), and I will say that the link between the metal pipes and the plastic feet, while ridiculously easy to set up, is a little bit wobbly--though it doesn\'t seem to affect the stability of the stand.

I didn\'t need anything fancy, so I ordered three of these carter\'s bassinet jersey sheets in white.  They are 100% cotton and very soft.  They fit very snugly over the changing pad. It could be maybe an inch or two longer to use on the changing pad we purchased that I linked to above, since on the long sides, the sheet pulls up a bit on the sides.  It\'s nothing that will inhibit its use, it just means you see a couple inches of the pad showing. This doesn\'t bother me since the pad and sheets are both white, and didn\'t cost a fortune like changing pad covers.

"2967","Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly","I have a wooden desk that seemed to be unchildproofable! I tried several different latch-style locks but nothing would fit because of the way the desk is built. I read some reviews on these Tot Loks and I have to admit I was afraid to buy them because everyone was saying that they are difficult to install.I bought some anyway. I found that they were EASIER to install than any two piece latch-style locks. With the latch-style, you have to do tedious measuring which I have zero patience with. Tot Loks come with little templates so, there is NO MEASURING involved!!My advice to anyone is to read the instructions over four or five times while sitting in front of your drawers or cabinets with all the pieces of the locks with you. After reading and looking for a while, I understood completely. I also suggest using some clear tape to tape down the template, especially on the side where you have to drill several holes. These take some time to install but, with a little patience, they are very simple and VERY effective! I\'m glad I got them and I will be getting more!",5

The one problem we had with it is getting the rear-facing recline right.  There are lines on the side of the seat that you need to level with the ground (we have a little tiny level that we carry around with the carseat when we move it to different cars), and had a terrible time getting it reclined far enough in our good-sized SUV.  Our solution: removing the base.  Between taking out the base and putting a rolled towel under the front of the seat, we got the recline angle right and were able to fit it in the middle back seat between the two front seats.  My daughter loves the roominess of the seat, and I love that her head no longer flops forward when she falls asleep.",NA

She needed a tight swaddle and most blankets you find in the store aren\'t big enough to really swaddle a non-newborn baby in.  These were perfect and since they came in a 4-pack, I could leave one at daycare, and spread them throughout the house for different uses.  She isn\'t swaddled anymore, but we love using these blankets for various reasons.  I\'ve used them to cover the stroller when it was windy or sunny.  I spread them on the floor/ground for her to play on.  And she uses them to sleep with too.  Definitely worth the money.",5

I couldn\'t have chosen a better cover.It comes with a hood-like  system that enhances proctection from the environment. When strollingoutdoors you can simply pull the hood down and insert it under the body cover, and it gives a fullcoverage to the baby.I also like the fact that it has a way to fold back the top layer for those times when the baby isin the car and she does not need to be so bundled up. It also allows the baby to see over it.The zippers seem to be good quality, they are very easy to zip up and down. The top layer comes completlyoff if you desire to remove it. The back layer is warm as well, and made of the same material as the top one.I have not seen my baby sweat in it once, and we have used it daily for 7 weeks now.

It folds to near nothing and has easily traveled in a diaper bag or carry-on.  It seems to be made well and we\'ve had no issues with wear.

We use the ""over the window"" hooks, which are far superior to the suction cups, although it does come with optional suction cups to secure the shade at the top of the window. The bottom of the shade is secured with a suction cup once you pull it down, and so far, it\'s been attached for 2+ weeks, and has not once come undone. I like the plain color of the shade, and the small, decorative owl - very \'sophisticated!\' I would absolutely buy this product again.",5

Unfortunately, without a crotch strap, it just wasn\'t enough to keep our 3 year old contained. Our son flies great outside of the buckle up time of take off and landing. My hope was this would be close enough to his car seat restraint that it would make him feel more comfortable and safe, therefore he would wear it. It was a no go. He got right out of it through the bottom and when we did convince him to wear it and he fell asleep, the restraints left marks on his neck (as other reviewers have stated). Overall, I would definitely recommend renting one if you have any concerns about it not working for your family. Our son flat out refused to wear it after the first flight and outside of forcibly holding him in it, it wasn\'t used again for the rest of the flights. Hope it works for others, but this was our experience. I gave it 2 stars since there was nothing physically wrong with the product, just didn\'t work for us.",2

It was very easy to set up and doesn\'t take up that much space which is important when you live in an apartment.Some users complained about the tray not being that easy to use with one hand but I haven\'t had that issue.  I\'m always holding my daughter in one hand, and sliding out the tray with the other hand and it works fine.My one minor complaint is that when you use the brake on a hard wood floor, the chair still moves a little bit.  The brake works much better on carpeting.Overall though, I\'m very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others.",5

"3019","Boppy Pillow with Brocade Slipcover, Black and White","When I first had my daughter and tried to nurse using the Boppy, I couldn\'t figure out what all the hype was about--it didn\'t come up high enough to be a support to my arm while I breastfed. At first, I ended up stuffing pillows turned on their end under my arm to create the support I needed. After we purchased a glider, I began using the Boppy again. Because it\'s kinda squished between the armrests, it stays up higher and I\'m able to use it to support my arms and my baby. It\'s only moderately useful on the couch or in a chair without armrests. If you\'re looking for something to support your arm/baby while bottle feeding, this product would probably be ideal for you because the baby doesn\'t need to be at breast level to drink a bottle. I borrowed a friend\'sMy Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst, and while I thought it was a little awkward with the backstrap and firm filling material, it kept my baby at the right height for nursing. The lactation consultants I spoke with highly recommended the My Brest Friend and told me the Boppy didn\'t provide the needed support, but I\'ve stuck with it anyway and it\'s worked for me.The things I like about this product:- I love the pink owl print--super cute.- Using the Boppy while nursing in front of others helps keep you covered--when I don\'t use it, I feel like I\'m always flashing my bare post-baby flabby stomach, even when I use a cover.- It\'s useful for nursing as long as I\'m in a chair with arms- I didn\'t use it much for reclining my baby (I did like theBoppy Newborn Lounger, Seed Rowfor the first few weeks), but I used it at first to help with tummy time, and now I use it behind her to protect her from falls while she\'s learning to sit.- The cover is fairly easy to take off and put on and is washable (essential for those frequent blowouts!)All in all, I\'m glad I own it, but if I hadn\'t been given one as a gift, I\'m not sure I would buy it myself.",3

I have heard several bad reviews about evenflo\'s pumps and with this pump I can see why. My first few times trying to pump with this thing I struggled to even cover the bottom of the bottle. I felt that the suction was very weak and the handle on the pump is just plain horrible? I spent over 20mins on the phone waiting for customer service and they basically told me no returns or refunds. So I try and try again and finally after several practices I can pump about 4oz in 30mins. Not to mention if the bottle or valve is a little wet... then it wont drop anything down into the bottle.

I had my baby in a German hospital and after failing breastfeeding (he had jaundice and it was so much work he wouldn\'t latch because he would get so tired and frustrated) I began pumping because I wanted him to have breastmilk....however possible. It was awful, the hospital had the really fancy medela pumps and I would pump and nothing would come out! Literally I sat for 40 mins and I got 5 ml out of BOTH breasts. I was so frustrated and almost completely gave up. I had bought this pump so I could freeze extra breast milk, so my husband reassured me and brought the pump to the hospital. (Batteries work great I know because the outlets here are different) I used this pump and the milk was flowing out! I don\'t know what the difference was, but this pumped worked for me when the medela didn\'t. A perfect case where you don\'t always get what you pay for because the medela is soooo expensive compared to this product. Also, their breast milk storage bags are a MUST!!!",5

"3037","Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Wipes Refill 350ct.","I love that they are free of many chemicals.  They also aren\'t irritating at all to my babies\' skin (quite a few wipes are), and I can also use these to wipe faces without worrying about them being too harsh. Performance-wise, I would say they are comparable to Pampers Sensitive wipes. You are going to need a few more to clean up messy poops than you would with Huggies wipes. Also like Pampers Sensitive, they aren\'t the most moist wipe out there. I would buy again, because they are natural and get the job done.",NA
"3038","OXO Tot Sippy Cup, Aqua, 7 Ounce","The valve falls out with pretty much every use. My son dropped it on the ceramic tile and the plastic cup split in two getting milk everywhere. He\'s only 13 months old so the cup didn\'t fall far. I feel that a sippy cup should be able to withstand a little more, but it\'s made out of a very thin plastic compared to other cups. Plus, the size is not right for us. 11 ozs is too big and 7 ozs is just a little to small.",1

We are very happy with this mattress and she sleeps much better with it. Now I need to find sheets that fit it. Not sure what the previous poster is saying about it ""saying inner spring"". Maybe I\'m missing something but I don\'t see anything saying that. Maybe they reviewed the wrong product. It is as it\'s described.",5
"3043","Railroad Train Baby Boy Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case","I bought this for my son, who is now 15 months old.  After Months of washing the quilt and sheet are still vibrant and in great shape.  The only thing that didnt hold up was the bumper.  My son ripped it apart from the strings that held it to his crib.  It is very cute though, I turned the part that said ""railroad"" into a window valence. It was too cute to get rid of.  When I bought it, it did not come with the diaper bag part, so I don\'t know how that is, it did come with odd things like the diaper holder and a little pillow...which I did not need or want and ended up throwing those out.  The price is fantastic for what you get, I highly recommend :)",5

He LOVES turtles and needs a night-light at night.  He has used it every single night since Christmas.  He even takes it on trips & sleepovers.  He enjoys choosing the color of the stars he will look at each night.  I love that it turns off by itself after awhile, so does not stay on all night.  So far, we have only replaced the batteries one time.I highly recommend this \'toy\' and want to point out that it is not just for babies!!",5

I\'m going to give this gift over and over again to every child\'s\' birthday party I go to, it\'s a HUGE hit.",5
"3053","Peg Perego Convertible Infant to Toddler Car Seat, Black","After my baby grew out of her infant car seat, I had spent plenty of time researching, reading online reviews, asking and comparing to find a perfect one for her next. I don\'t know since when I became such a car seat expert now hahaha....Anyway, I finally narrowed down to 2 brands that i think are the best in market: 1. Peg Perego and 2. Combi convertible car seats. These both have pros & cons depends on what type of car you have and how much you want to invest (for future coming kid(s) ) and your budget.I love this one the most out of those 2. The materials are superb, nice and expensive feeling; however, easily get stains from messy food. hehehe...but i guess you can clean it out though. The seat is compact and good looking. (Go to Baby r Us and you will see most of the car seats are bulky, it\'s not safe to have those covering up ur view, esp if u have a small car) For installation, my husband said it was hard for him but once he got it done, it\'s very stable and sturdy (I can\'t even move any inches at all). The most favorable feature that I love love on this one is my baby doesn\'t get sweat at all like the old cheap Graco we had. We took several road trips traveling on this and baby Amelie always came out clean and dry :). Not to mention she got a lot of sleep on the road, that shows how comfortable the chair is for her.Anyway, if you are out there wondering of what car seat you should get, i highly reccomend u to try this one out. It\'s totally worth the money and lastly, i want to add, this product is made from ITALY not china ... :)",5

"3055","BRICA I-Hide Car Seat Organizer with Tablet Viewer","This is a much better than the standard, no-frills seat protector we were using to protect the back of our passenger seat from our toddler\'s dirty shoes in his car seat. We do like it, but feel it is loaded with some features that are unnecessary and just clutter things up unnecessarily.Let\'s take a look at the features they bill as selling points:- Zips up to hide the mess. We like that we can zip it closed when we want to. We don\'t choose to do this too often, but if there are non-family members riding in the car, for example, it\'s nice to be able to tidy up relatively painlessly.- Big stuffable compartments. Well, this is OK but I feel there are too many compartments. It makes the whole thing feel too busy. Putting too much stuff in it can make it look bulky. But it does hold a lot, I have to admit - and that\'s good.- Tablet viewer. Holds up to a big screen tablet - fine for our small screen (Kindle Fire HD) as well. One problem, which may not be a problem at all, is that unless some special effort is taken, this is best for watching videos but not particularly great for listening to them. The sound gets out but not that great especially in a noisy moving car. On the other hand, if you have a long enough audio patch cord, you can plug the tablet into the car stereo for a good audiovisual experience. We don\'t do that, but we could.- Attachment system maximizes rear leg room - this is good.- Deluxe wipes case. Huh? Why would we want to take our wipes out of their ready-made, resealable wipes package and put them in this plastic case? I have heard legends of wipes that don\'t come in resealable packages. If you are determined to save a nickel a box or whatever it is to buy no-frills wipes, maybe this will be welcome to you. We found it completely superfluous, cheapskates though we are.So on the whole, this is a nice product and worth recommending.",4
"3056","OXO Tot Fork and Spoon Set, Green","I just love this tot feeding set. It is made of sturdy material, though it\'s a bit heavy compared to the plastic ones. It helped my toddler learning how to eat by himself.I highly recommend.",5

"3060","Diono Radian Center Buckle Strap (Formerly Sunshine Kids)","I recently got my 5 year old a Radian 80sl carseat. We love it, but the buckle was too hard for her to push open, which meant she couldn\'t buckle or unbuckle herself in anymore. Not that big of a deal right now, but we our having our 3rd child in May which means my daughter will be moving to the very back of the minivan and I would have to crawl back and forth to buckle her in. I\'m not sure what was wrong with the original buckle, but it was even hard for me to unbuckle at times. I decided to try getting a replacement buckle to see if it would solve the problem, and success! She can now get in and out of her seat by herself.",5
"3061","Green Chambray Folding Hamper","This hamper is such a nice piece to have!  The outside it very nice looking, it is very easy to set up, and the inside mesh bag is very easy to use.  Whenever you have a full hamper, you simply pull the mesh bag out, take it over to the washing machine, dump the clothes in, and return the mesh liner to the hamper.  I am so glad we purchased this--worth every penny!  I have noticed that there have been several reviews that harp on this product because the outside cloth shrinks in the wash.  I have not yet tried to wash the cloth part of the hamper so I cannot tell you if it shrinks or not.  After having used it for three months, I have not had to wash it yet, and I\'m not sure why you would even need to wash it all the time (as it appears many people are doing).  It works well for me!",5
"3062","Cloud b Dozy Dolphin On The Go  - Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds","Our daughter loves the sound of ocean waves to help her sleep or to soothe her in the carseat.

No tools needed-One hand tray removal, can adjust 5 positions and put close to small 6 month old baby-Recline is easy to use-Cushion is easy to wipe after each use when you wipe table. Cushion is easily removed to put in machine if extra dirty-Height adjustments easy to do-Can remove tray and bring chair to dining table-5 point harness straps are easy to use and tight enough for small 6 month old-Clean modern look without being space age-y-Wheels glide smoothly, easy to move baby to kitchen when I\'m cooking and back to dining area when eating. Brakes simple to use and available on all four castersCons:Not foldable, but this is not an issue for us as we keep it out.  The footprint is about the same as most high chairs we\'ve seen.

"3075","North States Supergate Extra Tall Easy Close Gate, Bronze","This gate was placed in a hallway to keep a grandchild out of our bedroom, office, and guest bathroom. In that regard it works perfectly. My one concern was whether it would prevent our cat from getting to her food and litterbox, however she jumps over it easily.The installation, especially with the extensions, can be tricky. I laid the gate down on the carpet, fitted the pins and extensions on, then used the plastic protective wrapping to tie the extensions to the gate frame. Another piece was used to hold the gate in the closed position. This made the assembly much easier to manage.My installation process went as follows. 1) With a 36"" level, make two pencil marks slightly above where the disks will go. Use a roofing square or other large right angle to transfer a matching baseboard mark to the other side. Don\'t bother making the other mark on the other part of the wall.Dry fit the cups on the first wall centered under the marks. Fasten the baseboard cup to the wall. Dry fit the upper cup and fasten that in place next. Now place the baseboard cup on the other side. At this point, start extending the screws for the pressure fit. Keeping the upper gate frame free on the opposite side will allow you to make the small adjustments for the gate to close square. Once that\'s achieved, mark where the cup is set, tilt the gate down, fasten the cup to the wall, and retighten the pressure screws.",5

From the moment we brought our son home from the hospital, he\'s slept in the adorable napper side and absolutely loves it. There\'s so many features about this Pack N\' Play that are just simply great. The napper lining (with the adorable pooh bear headrest) is pretty easy to take off and throw in the washing machine. (My son had quite a few leaky pee-pee diapers.) The little motorized part that vibrates, plays music and lights up is great, too. We sometimes use the vibrating part as sort of a ""snooze"" button in the morning, when he just starts fussing and might be able to go back to sleep on his own. It works GREAT! He loves the vibrations and it helps to soothe him for sure. I highly recommend this product and honestly don\'t know how I would survive without it!",NA

"3087","Skip Hop Dunks Stacking Bath Toy, Blue, Green, Yellow","It seem like older my baby gets, the more STUFF we end up with. He is almost 9 months old and his STUFF has moved into the bathroom...specifically, the bath tub. Most baby stuff is not visually appealing to me at all; in fact, I find most of it pretty ugly. These, on the other hand, are very nice! They have a clean, simple design and a nice color combination. They stack on the side of the tub and I like the way they look there. They work okay rinsing him off...they are a little small. But, I\'d rather have small pretty birds sitting next to the tub than a big plastic pitcher. They also float and it was brilliant to sell them in a package of three -- I start to wash my son, he takes the bird from me and sticks it in his mouth and I grab another bird and keep washing him. I love outsmarting the baby. Also, they are made from safer plastic so I feel okay letting him chew on them.",4

However, I have not attempted to take them off yet, and i\'m sure a little \'Goo-Gone\' or rubbing alcohol will do the trick when the time comes.  I will be dissapointed if they harm some of the finish, but then again you can\'t put a price on protecting your precious child from severe injury, which can easily occur when their head hits a table or desk corner!

I then decided to buy the Medela which i love i went from taking 20-30 to get 4oz to 10-15 minutes getting 9-10 ozs.

They\'re not crayons, they are chalk and at the end of the day some of it will get on your hands. I don\'t understand other reviewers commenting how it on their hands..but it\'s by far the best solution I found for kids who love to draw and erase again and again. Highly recommend it because your kids will highly have fun with them. Just make sure you test it first, because I ruined my small Fisher Price retro chalk board using it. It wouldn\'t come off.

"3112","Disney Pooh Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats , 50-Count","We finally got smart and made the wise investment in these placemats! Wish we had done so with our first and second babies! It is a great solution for early feeders while eating out! We just adhere the placemat to the table and over the edge  and put baby\'s food on the placemat for him to pick up. Don\'t have to worry about the table being clean or not, baby throwing/dropping serving dish.The first time we used it, my husband didn\'t drape it over the edge of the table at first and so adjusted it. Our 11 month old son saw it being pulled up and proceeded to mimic that so we ended up battling keeping it stuck down to the table. I think it being lifted and re-stuck make it easier for baby to pull up, too.The next time we used it, we made sure it covered the edge of the table before putting him in the high chair. No problems with him trying to pull it up and it was a peaceful lunch! He did chew/suck on the edge of the table (thus why we covered the edge) which snagged the plastic a little, but was no a big deal since we just to it off and threw it away.Great product and great price! It was definitely worth the money for us!",4

I know some folks have complained about the thinness being a leak factor, but I found that if your boobs are going to down pour there is nothing going to stop them! All the pads I\'ve tried leaked at some point. Once my milk flow was steady it was no longer a problem, anyway, but I know we are all different. Also the price point is great. I couldn\'t and wouldn\'t buy the really pricey pads, so I am very pleased with these.",5

And that it is the one cup that does not roll under the sofa.UPDATE:After just a few uses, it broke! The bottom seam opened.

It was very easy to set up and fits great in my family room.My son didn\'t like it at first, he was annoyed by the seperation it caused between him and my wife, but was over that extremely quickly.  This play yard gives my wife the opportunity to take a break from chasing him and having to pick him up and away from the things he shouldn\'t be playing with.  The break allows her to give her back a rest as well.I did buy the extensions so he would have more room to play.  My wife has not connected both ends as of yet, she just uses it to connect two walls together and it keeps my son at bay.  If you have the space, I definitely recommend the extensions.All in all, my wife and I very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone with an active and roaming child.",5

A few things that dropped it 1 star are: WiFi netbook and phones are affected while it\'s on and near the devices.

The seat is great with a very high back.  The recline feature does need two hands to adjust, is very handy, and does not move once set.  The basket is nicely sized but access is very limited when the seat is reclined, as with all umbrella strollers.  The lap belt could be easier to adjust, but once it\'s set it says put.  Pushing this stroller is a dream; I think it is just as good, if not better, than a Maclaren.  And a nice bonus, the wheels don\'t touch the hood when closed, no dirty spots on your stroller.

It didnt\'t survive for my second, not that I would have really used it if it had.  I think it fell from a shelf and the bottom cracked.  So not that durable in the end either.

If you saw the reviews about the uneven seating of the feet, unfortunately that is also true. The center plastic bolt is too thick making the rubber feet on the perimeter unable to reach the floor so the metal  base noisily rocked back and forth. I fixed this in 2 seconds flat by placing small round felt stick okn furniture pads to all the outer rubber feet. That elevated the swivel base higher than the center bolt. Now the ride is smooth and steady and whisper quiet. The size is perfect. The seat is cushy, the fabric is super soft and stain resistant so 5 stars for the little chair that could!!",5

"3175","The First Years Sounds for Silence Deluxe Sound Machine","This was purchased to help my new born sleep at night.  We didn\'t really care for the nature settings, but that really isn\'t the problem with this machine.  The first one we had stopped working completely.  It wasn\'t getting power at all.  Defects happen, so we contacted customer service and they sent us a replacement.  Not long after that the same thing happened.  We had enough at this point and gave up on this model, brand, and sound machines in general.We took an old android phone and downloaded a white noise app.  Keep  that plugged in all night and it has a ton of options.You are better off buying a cheap used phone to replace this terrible sound machine.  Or even get an app for your current phone if the sound is for you instead of a baby.",1

"3184","Dreambaby Pressure Mount Hallway Gate with Extensions, Black","Pros:Easy to installAttractiveDoors close by themselvesCons:Easy for a toddler to figure outLatch mechanism on the cheap sideNot that sturdy with the extensions.I purchased two of these and need to keep a baby and two toddlers out of an area.  As previous reviewers stated, the install is a cinch. Doesn\'t require any tools and looks nice. It won\'t work for us though as the gate was easily defeated by my three year-old son after the 2nd day. The latch just isn\'t great even compared to other baby gates.  True, it\'s easy to open and will close by itself which I love, but it feels fairly cheap to me and of course the fact that my son so easily opened it makes the gate a waste of money. I\'ll go back and inspect it some more but the thumb trigger takes very little pull to activate which makes it easy for small children which is of course exactly who you\'re trying to prevent from using it.I don\'t think it\'s asking too much for this gate to keep out a three year-old. He can\'t open several of our gates. The one with the handle that you squeeze by gripping the bottom and top plate together is ergonomic (as opposed to thumb triggers) and takes more strength than a small child has. I wish there were more like it.",3

It\'s very secure when attached to our dining room chair, and if we have people over and need to use the chair for an adult it\'s easy to remove the seat and store it somewhere else.  We have also removed the seat and simply put it on the ground if we\'re eating in a different room of the house or someone else\'s house and it\'s a very safe way to keep her secure while she\'s eating.",5

But I guess Medela doesn\'t expect that or doesn\'t care!The instruction manual made it seem as if you need a a different size if your nipple is smaller but it\'s a total rip off because all sizes are the same!

"3196","Evenflo Majestic High Chair","I am not one to write a review, but the Evenflo high chair is so dangerous and the company so negligent, that I had to let others know.  The Evenflo Majestic Highchair has recently, finally, been recalled.  We had issues with the screws popping out of the recliner section of the chair when we used it with our then 6 month old, I called Evenflo last March, they sent me a repair kit with longer screws, still didn\'t work. Customer service had told me then this was not a common problem and that even with a screw missing, highchair was safe to use, not dangerous. I\'m so furious they lied about my son\'s safety!!!!! Our longer screws did pop out a few times, we put them back in, I called back and since the highchair still held up fine and they told me it was okay to use, we wrongly trusted Evenflo and continued to use the highchair (my husband had checked it and felt is was okay). I just called in response to last weeks recall and they said they do have a record of me calling, sorry that happened and would I like a new set of screws? They won\'t give a refund and the new screws (which they will ship out in approx. 2 weeks, and recommend we don\'t use the highchair in the meantime) supposedly work better than the original replacements. I am returning this to the store, and if they won\'t accept the return, I\'ll have to eat the cost and throw out the chair.  We\'ve had so many of our kids\' things recalled, it\'s infuriating that these companies only have to send screws that may or may not work and before their belated recalls, our kids are at risk and to boot this time they assured me there was no danger. Please do not buy Evenflo and know that you can\'t trust the info you receive from customer service.I\'m am so thankful my son wasn\'t injured. We\'ve had other issues with most of our Evenflo products not working correctly, but all involving bells and whistles not structual. I just can\'t understand how these companies put more money into their impossible to open packaging than into their product safety.",1

"3198","Munchkin White Hot Safety Bath Cradle","Whoever created this was a genius! I tried using a cute-trendy bathtub and it was the worst. It had bells and whistles but was not functional at all, not to mention my daughter was not comfortable in it.  I am a first time mom and after telling a friend about the bad bathtub experience she gave me this as a gift.  She has three children of her own and she said that this was the best thing ever. Oh was she right!  This can go in the sink, bathtub, counter, and really on any surface.  My daughter was very comfortable laying on it and she did not roll around or slide down like in some bathtubs.  The sponge/foam stays warm with the water and its easy to rinse the baby off. I cannot express how happy I am with this product.My daughter is four months old and I am still using this.  I will continue to use it until she outgrows it! I am actually going to purchase another one since mine gets so much use.  This is so much cheaper than the other fancy bathtubs and absolutely worth every penny! I will definitely be giving this as a gift to fellow moms & dads!  In this case simple is totally better!!!!",5

I wouldn\'t want to sit back there for a 500 mile trip though. Trips around town should be just fine.I skimmed the instruction (as all men do) and had the car seat in the car in less than 10 min. It was a little tight back there when installing.My 23# 11 month old seems to like it just fine.Personally I\'m not worried about the bad reviews relating to toxins.

"3219","Stork Craft Beatrice Combo Tower Chest, White","After reading so many negative reviews on this dresser, I was a bit skeptical about getting it. I am SO glad I did! First off, the shipping for this was SUPER cheap (I live in Alaska and the shipping was only $22 for UPS 2 day). Stork Craft did a great job packaging everything. Nothing was broken, every piece had it\'s own wrapping, and none of the hardware was missing. The wood for the insides of the drawers and the parts that are not seen are made of thick particle board, but the outsides are all a nice stained wood. There is LOTS of room in this thing to store baby gear and can be used as a dresser for when the baby gets older. Also, the lower portion of the dresser is the perfect place to put a changing pad. One down side to this dresser is that it takes a while to put together. There are quite a few parts, but the instructions are very clear and easy to read (much easier than putting the crib together). All and all, I am very happy I purchased this for my kiddo\'s room. It looks nice and is of exceptional quality. As long as you take care of this, it will last a long time!",5

If you don\'t have them then your child can balance the table on their lap, but it will make it more difficult.To let you know my kids are now 15 and 9 and we STILL USE our Tabby Trays for eating in the car...studies, homework, crafts, long car trips...etc.  So its not the disposable item that you may think it is.  Both my kids are great at keeping the tray on their laps...but for toddlers arm rests are a MUST!!For our car seats....we looked for them with arm rests and for our stroller...our Combi fit the bill great, even after we took off the front part!I can not tell you enough how great this item is...every time I went shopping with my daughter (she is the 15 year old now) I put the tray on the stroller and she would play, snack, drink and keep herself very happy while I did the business of being a MOM! I owned the very first generation of these trays and would be stopped in the store by Mom\'s begging me to provide them the ""WHERE TO GET IT"" info.  They were so hard to find, at first, that I sold them out of my car...ha!  When my daughter was done using the tray or wanted it of...I just used the strap to attach it to the handle on the back of the stroller and kept on going.My son never had a day without the tray and to this day (he is the 9 year old) it saves us many a disaster when eating in the car is a sad fact of life.  With the cup holder, we never loose our drinks and it keeps two kids very happy food and creativity wise for those LONG car trips.  I keep a set (of two) in the trunk of our Honda and a second set (of two) in the back area of my Expedtion.  They take up almost no space upright and we are never without our OPTION for ease of use!!!  Baby Wipes (Huggies Supreme) make clean ups a breeze and the trays are ready for the next time.  If really messy, I take them inside for a quick wash up and put them back in the ready position.Hope this review helps all you mom\'s think of some LONG TERM USAGE for these great Trays.

The adhesive sets for 24 hours and pitches a fit even if you try to redo them within 5 minutes.

"3234","Chicco Lullaby LX Playard Romantic","I registered for and received this play yard, and when my baby was about a month old I went out and bought the graco one.  This one has done nothing for the past few months in my house except collect dust.  Here\'s a list of pros and cons:Pros:- The black & grey is a sleek, modern look - considering this is going to be a piece of furniture in your living space, it\'s nice that it\'s simple, clean look.  However, the skirt/dustruffle along the bottom does not present as neatly as it does in the product photo (see cons below).- You can wheel it around while it\'s fully packed up (with the Graco one, the wheels pack into the cover so you can\'t roll it once you\'re all zipped up).- The vibrating unit has a neat light that captures the baby\'s attention, may be soothing to some.- The arches with the animals hanging off is a good idea and the whole mat can be removed and put onto the floor if you prefer to play with it there.Cons:- HEAVY, bulky.- VERY stubborn to fold up.  I wrestled with this thing for a good half hour the first time I put it away, despite having followed the directions closely.- When the mat is installed to the high position for newborns, there are hook & eye loops that secure it to the sides.  They are SO difficult to fasten, my father-in-law and I had to take turns trying!- When the arches with the animals are up, it\'s very difficult to put a sheet on the mat - the arches fasten under 4 corners of the mat and it directly interferes with a fitted sheet.- The loops that hold the animals on are very poorly designed - like a cheap afterthought.  The animals slip off very easily.- When the arches are up it\'s very awkward to try to take the baby in and out.- The changing station is not comfortable.  It\'s just this plasticky material that isn\'t suited to any sort of fabric sheet or cover that you can buy to put over it.  I never used the changing station.- The dust ruffle along the bottom is all wrinkled when you take it out of the box and I could not figure out how to flatten it out.  I wonder how you\'d take an iron to that!  I had the thing open in my living room for 5 months and the wrinkles never smoothed out.",NA

I did a ton of research on carriers (which I SWORE I would never buy) and it was a no-brainer to order the Gemini. It was SOOOOO easy to use... he loved facing in and out, and fell asleep within 10 minutes of being it it. There was no strain on my back what-so-ever.Also... he is sitting in such a natural position.

These seem to be great.  Would give 5 stars if I knew how well they handle the wash.",4
"3241","Medela Breastmilk Collection and Storage Bottles 8oz (250ml) - 1 Bottle ONLY","I read most of the previous reviews and noticed a few of them claimed that this bottle was not a real Medela bottle.  This is not true.  Medela\'s newer bottle have the ounces/ML\'s printed on the bottle in black, while the previous design actually has the ounces/ML\'s stamped into the side of the bottle (you can feel them with your fingers because they are raised).  The bottle being sold here are the type with the raised/stamped measurements (no black print).  Pro to the black printing: easier to see.....but a con is that the printing eventually rubs off and you are left with NO measurement.  I have had those bottles for 6 months and they are already rubbing off.  I like the ones being sold here because you will never lose the measurements.  Great quality bottle, fast shipping.",5
"3242","Fisher-Price Private Connection Monitor","We\'ve been using the monitor for a couple months and have found it to be an average product.  My main problem is the receiever isn\'t very sensitive.  You have to turn the volume way up in order to hear sounds in the baby\'s room.  But the more you turn up the volume the more static you hear.  So every night before bed we adjust the volume to be low enough that the static doesn\'t keep us awake and high enough that we actually hear the baby when she makes noise.  It\'s annoying.  We had a Sony monitor that had a feature where it only made noise when the baby made noise - otherwise it was totally silent.  I wish all monitors had that feature.",3

"3248","Glass Bottles Triple-Pack 9oz","I was determined to use glass bottles for my son, I didn\'t want to have to worry about plastics.  These are nice solid bottles that I am extremely pleased with.  The teachers at his daycare often tell me how much nicer they are than any of the other bottles and that the milk stays warmer longer.These are heavier then plastic, but my son (now 9 mo.) is able to hold them and feed himself, he has been for a few months now.  So, they are obviously not too heavy for him.I have seen some complaints about the multiple parts, but I don\'t mind them.  It really doesn\'t take that much longer to wash an extra piece or two.  My son hasn\'t had any gas issues and has spit-up maybe 6 times in his whole life.  I don\'t know if this is because of the bottles or not, but if taking more time to wash an extra piece means that he\'s gas and spit-up free, I\'m ok with it.  I am a working Mom, so I understand the value of time, but I also understand the value of quality.It took me a while, but I was finally able to find and purchase a few Born Free Pump Adaptors.  They work perfectly with these bottles (and the 9 oz.) and my Medela Pump In Style.  I wish I had found them sooner, they are definitely worth it!  It is so nice to be able to pump directly into the bottles and not deal with as many plastic bags.I have also purchased the separate pieces to transform these into sippy cups and I love that these bottles can grow with him.",NA

"3258","Joovy Groove Ultralight Umbrella Stroller, Charcoal","I\'ve put an embarrassing amount of time into researching the right lightweight stroller that met the needs of my family. Ultimately, I feel that the Joovy Groove Ultralight is the best in terms of price versus features.The well-padded seat is nice and deep. I\'m a fan of the adjustable footrest because it means my stubby 9 month old can sit comfortably without her legs dangling awkwardly. The 149 degree recline capability is reminiscent of our Britax B-Agile and the seat buckles latch and unlatch more smoothly than the B-Agile\'s. There are small, reflective triangles sewn on the sides of the seat plus collapsable, mesh cup holders on the inner sides of the seat.I\'m 5\'0"" and I find the height of the handles to be comfortable. The stroller is extremely easy to maneuver and push. Our Britax stroller organizer fits perfectly on the Joovy Groove Ultralight; however, I haven\'t kept the organizer attached while folding and unfolding. There is a mesh cup holder and zippered pouch for the parent so an additional stroller organizer isn\'t completely necessary.You have the option of locking the front wheels so that they don\'t turn from side to side. The back wheels each have their own brake. I like how the material of the basket\'s bottom isn\'t mesh like that of the UPPAbaby G-Luxe that we were considering. I fly solo with the baby a lot so I appreciate the carrying strap.The only negative aspect that I can think of is that I\'m still getting used to folding and unfolding this stroller. I\'m so used to the B-Agile that I still get flustered with the Joovy Groove Ultralight\'s step-lock mechanism.***UPDATE***I\'ve had more time with our Joovy Groove Ultralight and the verdict remains the same: worth the price! Once you get the hang of unfolding and folding the stroller, everything is a piece of cake.I\'ve purchased the JL Childress padded umbrella stroller travel bag for our stroller since we fly a good amount. It\'s a snug fit but it works. Our JJ Cole bundleme urban in the toddler size fits perfectly on the Joovy Groove Ultralight. If you\'re feeling lazy, the stroller folds and locks up without a hitch even if you leave the bunting attached.As for the basket, I can shove the Ergo and Skip Hop Versa bag in there and I\'ll still have room if I make a purchase at a store. I love the convenience of the zippered pouch located on the back of the stroller. I\'ve found the cup holder to be more suited in holding my phone rather than beverage, however. A regular sized, full water bottle pitches in the cup holder.Lastly, Buy Buy Baby carries the Joovy Groove Ultralight in both black and grey if you\'re not feeling the blue or purple.Hope that all helps. Happy stroller researching!",NA

"3261","DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01","I purchased two of these for my two children and decided to send them back. I think that when people buy sound machines, they are buying for one of two reasons (or perhaps both). Some people buy sound machines to soothe their little one, and some buy sound machines to block other noises out. I was looking for a sound machine that would block other noises out. Though the children are in separate rooms, they were waking one another up.The reviews on the volume of this sound machine were mixed, but we decided to give it a try. This sound machine was NOT loud enough to block out noises from another room. And I am not talking about screaming; I am talking about baby whimpering/TV/etc. We kept the machines for a few days and the children were still waking each other up. If you are looking for a sound machine to help soothe your baby or to keep him/her to sleep, I think this is probably a great sound machine. For the price, it has many options and comes with a lifetime warranty. The lifetime warranty is what drew us to buy this sound machine in the first place because we have gone through so many other sound machines that stopped working.However, if you are looking for something loud enough to block noises from another room, I\'m afraid this sound machine would not work for you. I would like to say that Amazon promptly refunded my money, and I didn\'t want to give this sound machine a bad rating because for certain people, I think this would be a great option.",NA

"3263","Baby Jogger City Select Second Seat Kit, Onyx","We\'ve had our double city select for a little over a year now and the front wheels lose traction all the time. It might not sound like a big deal, but it\'s a huge safety concern. This typically happens when crossing the street or intersections, and when it loses traction, the front wheels &#34;freak out&#34; to the point you can\'t push the stroller. Very frightening when crossing an intersection! I do like how this stroller is narrow and works for shopping malls, but it is very heavy when you have a 16 month old and almost 3 year old in it. Great sun canopy\'s and the magnetic flap is very smart. I can\'t give it more then two stars simply for the fear it causes every time we leave the sidewalk.",NA
"3264","Playtex Standard BPA Free Disposable Nurser Liners 4 oz - 100 Count","I have been using these for about a week and I actually like them better than the drop-ins. With the drop-ins that I have, they are easy to crush, making it difficult to get an accurate measure of liquid. I found myself using my finger or a spoon to un-crush the drop-ins. The first day I used these liners I didn\'t put them on correctly, which caused leakage. But, now that I pull the bags over the bottles correctly, I haven\'t had any problems (the tabs should be fairly easy to pull off if you have them on correctly). I also like that I can reach through the bottom of the bottle to make sure that the liner isn\'t bunched up, thus helping my problem of getting a fairly accurate read on how much milk I put in. I have frozen one bag of milk so far without any problems. I didn\'t tear the tabs off and then I tied a rubber band around the bag tightly. It seems to have frozen nicely. The only disadvantage to the liners is that I would probably feel more comfortable dumping the defrosted milk into a new bag, versus with the drop-ins where I could put them right into a bottle to defrost.",5
"3265","BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","I wasn\'t sure about this when I ordered it, but am absolutely sold after a month\'s use.  My 6-month old loses pacifiers at night and they fall behind the crib (as they did with my 2 1/2 year old)...instead of fishing them out in the dark of the night, they\'re all contained in the crib now with the breathable bumper.  Also, even when my baby has her faced pressed against the crib wall/bumper, I don\'t worry at all about SIDS since she can still breath with the mesh material of the bumper.  I wish I had this 2 years ago when my oldest was in the crib.  I highly recommend it!!",NA

"3268","Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White","I use baby gates to keep my house rabbits out of the bedrooms. I was hurdling my plastic baby gates because I was too lazy to fumble with the aggravating extend and latch mechanisms which led to a couple of scary falls.I wanted something that was easy to open single handed, which it is.  I also really wanted something that would look good as I would be leaving it in place in the hallway for all to see.I chose the Extra Tall Dreambaby gate because I did not want to bend over to open.For my application I performed a simple mod ...I added plexi-glass to prevent somebunny from pushing their tiny head thru the bars. Our Holland Lops range from 3 to 3.5 lbs and while they certainly could not get thru the bars, the curious ones would put their head thru the bars.Bottom line is I really like this gate, it\'s easy to open and the bottom of the door can not be pushed out of place as the door sits in a small u-channel requiring the door to be lifted before opening. If you have a dog or other animal that aggressively tried to push the door open at the bottom this would prevent that from happening.",NA

Given how stinky our toddler\'s diapers have been lately, it\'s amazing how well it contains the odors.  You might smell a little something if it the bag is full, but that\'s about it.  When she was on breastmilk or formula, we never smelled a thing.  I\'m giving the pail 4 stars instead of 5 because it looks like she might be able to get the pail open (with difficulty).

I have tried bottle brushes and straw cleaner brushes and it is still very difficult. Besides that little cleaning issue these are great!",NA
"3304","Munchkin High Capacity Drying Rack, White","Before I purchased this drying rack I placed bottles and accessories on towels to dry.  Now the bottles that were spread out all over my kitchen counters are condensed into a nice, neat little space.  My little one goes through 8 or 9 bottles in a 24 hour period.  This drying rack will hold all of them (bottles, nipples, collars, caps) plus breast pump pieces.  I love that this drying rack takes up such a small space.  The only thing I hate is that I didn\'t buy it sooner.",NA

"3306","Bumbleride Indie Twin Stroller, Lava","We owned a duallie revolution for our boys that we 12 months apart and I don\'t know why on earth the other people on here think the bob is better. The SINGULAR thing that the bob does better is it folds down smaller. THAT IS IT!!!  The indie has two front wheels so I feel it is more stable up front, it is smaller in distance from front to back and the underneath is actually accessible. The bob has a pole going right down the middle blocking off the storage underneath. And when you own a double stroller that means you dont pack light.  The sun shades fold down further on the indie and when they are totally folded in they don\'t rest on my kids head like the bob did. I also prefer the Indie\'s design of holding carseats. With the bob you have to purchase an additional attachment. Blah...I have twins I don\'t need one more thing to store or remember where it is when I need it. The people who were complaining about the front wheels moving when jogging must have a defective one or something. The indie feels just like the bob as far as pushing with weight and one wheel vs. two front wheels. Oh, the back rest is much stronger on the indie as well. Our twins aren\'t completely stable sitting up and they hated the bob and would roll towards the center pole. The indie is much more supportive. I also prefer the indie\'s straps.  My bob did have parent &#34;cup holders&#34; if you can call them that. It was a fabric small bag that barely fit most water bottles. The indie doesn\'t have those but I am planning on purchasing a universal (and larger) one. I really help this review helps someone considering I am someone who has owned both most popular double joggers. It seems there are a lot of reviews on here when people have only owned one or the other. There is no perfect double stroller. It doesn\'t exist. Find the one that works best for you. Oh, also I own a Toyota sienna and we have to turn off our automatic hatch door to shut the back. The bob fit fine. I have to turn the indie on its side to get it to fit. If you owned a large SUV it wouldn\'t be an issue.",5

Part of the reason I picked the Munchkin pail was because of all the positive reviews. But I was not impressed. First of all, it doesn\'t contain the smell, which is kind of the whole point. And second, I did not like having to open the compartment with my hand. You\'re trying to hold the dirty diaper in one hand and open the diaper pail with the other. But your baby is probably still on the changing table so you want to keep a hand on him or her as well. Unfortunately I only have two hands so this was always awkward for me.I have several friends with the Diaper Genie and they\'ve never had a problem with the smell and it opens with a foot pedal.

"3335","Foundations Quad Lx 4-Passenger Stroller, Earthscape, Taupe/Red","We purchased the Foundations Quad LX 4-Passenger Stroller for our family (One 3year old and 1year old triplets). Besides the obvious reason for needing 4 seats, we also wanted a stroller that had a high weight capacity, so that the kids didn\'t out-grow it too fast (2 of our triplets are already 30 lbs, most strollers have a 35lb weight capacity per seat).It took me about 45 minutes to assemble the stroller, by myself {I\'m a relatively handy person}. I did have trouble with the runaway break installation, and could not figure it out. I did somehow manage to get it so that the wheels were not locked.This is a big stroller. It is heavy. I am 5\'5"" and I honestly can\'t imagine anyone shorter than that using this stroller, because of the height of the push bar.I also can\'t imagine someone who is very slight pushing this stroller once it\'s loaded with kids. The stroller weighs about 90lbs, the combined weight of my kids is 110lbs, so that\'s 200lbs to push.We kept having issues with the runaway break lines slipping off {remember we had not assembled them correctly to begin with}. We tried to assemble them correctly, and one of the key pieces {that attaches it to the pull bar} snapped when we pulled on it {there had been no pressure or wear on this piece}. After that we just decided to disassemble the stroller and remove the pins that locked the wheels if the bar wasn\'t pulled. It works great now and is no issue. Of course, it does mean there is no runaway break now, but I honestly can\'t imagine pushing this stroller up or down too many hills.I will say that the chest straps are rather cheap...It\'s a d-ring that has a piece of nylon strap running through it. My kids are able to get out of the shoulder straps pretty easily, but the strap around the waist is pretty secure.It does fit through regular doors, particularly our front door and our doctor\'s office\'s door, which were the big things. Again it is big though. The overall dimensions are 53"" from the ground to the highest point, 33"" at the widest point, and 56"" from the footrests to the handlebar. It does fold up and fit in our trunk on it\'s side {Chrysler T&C; 2008 Touring}, but there is no room for anything else, not even a small box of car supplies.Once we dealt with the break issue, we\'ve been really happy with the stroller.Updated January 2014During the course of the summer we experienced issue with how the stroller was holding up. The nylon straps that hold the back seats in an upright position ripped apart, meaning the seat is now permanently reclined {even if it is only a few inches}. I contacted Foundations about the issue, as well as about a mildew issue {our stroller is kept on our enclosed porch, and we rarely go out in bad weather, however, our stroller has developed a really BAD mildew issue on the back of the front seats, on the canopy and on the seats}.After several days of going back and forth in email with the manufacturer and providing pictures of the issues. They agreed that they would send us a new replacement for the back straps that had torn, but would not do anything in regards to the mildew issue. I was pleased that they were willing to DO SOMETHING, but disappointed that I had to haggle with them to stand behind their product. A new seat unit was shipped to us, since the straps had broken on our\'s, we received it promptly.I have been relatively disappointed in the quality of the stroller, this is a quad stroller, meaning 4 kids, with a weight limit of 50lbs for each seat {none of our children are near that weight} and the stroller has held up much less satisfactory than I thought it should in less than a year\'s use. We use the stroller several times a week to walk around the block where we live, it\'s very rarely used in poor weather and isn\'t used on a regular enough basis to warrant it\'s condition. Why mildew resistant fabric wasn\'t used on the stroller is beyond me, I\'m hoping that this coming summer I can scrub it down so that it at least doesn\'t smell anymore.",NA
"3336","Angelcare Bath Support, Blue","So far I like this bath support. The main reason for four stars is that it says it supports up to 24 inch babies. Well, my little man was born at 22 inches and was already 23 inches less than a month later. It seems like it would support him well past 24 inches but apparently not, so I don\'t expect to get much more use out of it.

"3347","Evenflo Modern 200 High Chair, Tangerine","I\'m two weeks in and have to return it. I thought the reviews here saying it was easy to clean were enough reason to ignore the fact that the cover is cloth, absorbing your baby\'s every spill.If you\'re child is a particularly calm or neat eater, or you are just starting out with feeding, you may not notice the messes.Just wait until your child is a toddler!Pros:The fabric design is great. If this review was based solely on something aesthetically pleasing, I\'d be delighted. Loved the look.Cons:-The wheels on the front make it awkward to move. This may not be an issue for everyone.-Was looking forward to the yellow tray insert to make it easier to clean. However, my toddler pulls it right off, making a mess out of both trays.-Still takes up a fair amount of room.-Seat cover is not extremely difficult to remove for laundering, but it is obnoxious enough where I wouldn\'t do it enough. Almost couldn\'t get the straps separated so I could maneuver them through the cover. Food is still getting stuck under cover. A lot of it.Going without the cover is not optional either, because of hinge placement, etc. Took many open nooks and crannies.-Overall construction is subpar to my Fisher Price space saver high chair. One-handed tray removal mechanism is really cheap and segment. I pretty much drop the tray every time. If I didn\'t have a cheaper high chair to compare it to that was better, I wouldn\'t have noticed this. Moves up and down easily, but the construction of that mechanism seems cheap also.Overall, wasn\'t worth the money for all the pitfalls.

At 10 months the size med sack is almost too short for him but the armhole is WAY too big.

It said my temperature was around 97.1.  The highest my son\'s read was 99.1 and the under arm reading was 101.5.  I don\'t trust it as it is very inconsistent and I followed the directions by letting it get room temperature and holding it the appropriate distance.  Great concept but lacking in deliverance.

"3378","Econobum Full Kit","I have never cloth diapered before and while pregnant with my 2nd child became interested in the whole idea.  I did a lot of reading and researching and in looking at the money and the reviews from many people, I decided that Econobum was the best choice.  It\'s true that the diaper covers aren\'t as fun or cute as other brands but when you can get everything you need for cloth diapering until potty training age for around $100, to me it was worth it.  Other brands with the fun patterns can cost $400-800 and especially since I didn\'t know how I was going to do with cloth diapering, I didn\'t want to spend an arm and a leg just for vanity\'s sake.  So many reviews said great things about Econobum, and the main things that got me were the price and the fact that so many people said they never leaked.  I am now almost 2 months in and would say I definitely like them.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the prefolds are extremely bulky on a newborn.  I had read about this being a problem but figured it would be ok since my baby was large at birth, 8 lbs 13 oz and drinks a ton of formula each day - thus he is growing like a weed and is 6 weeks old and well over 11 lbs.  Anyway, the diapers will work for a newborn but just know they will look totally hysterical because they\'re so huge.  I admit I was/am embarrassed to take my son out in public with them on so until he gets big enough for them to fit and look normal we are using disposables when we leave the house!  Beyond that vanity, we do use them at home even though at 11 some pounds they are still very bulky on him.  I\'m guessing when he gets closer to 15 they will start to fit better.  I have also considered ordering ""infant"" size prefolds that are smaller and just using those for now with the covers.  Doing that would still probably be cheaper than buying disposables for a few months.  As for washing them, I find it extremely easy.  I don\'t mind doing laundry and already do loads every other day or 2 days, so washing cloth diapers wasn\'t really an issue to me.  I have an LG front load set and it gets mine super clean.  They come out of the dryer smelling like fresh nothing - which is what is supposed to happen (mine have never smelled like urine or ammonia or feces).  I wash them on the sanitary cycle with a prewash and an extra rinse - I use Tiny Bubbles detergent and it works great - so far I\'ve never had any stains.  I air dry the covers.  All in all I would definitely recommend this brand to anyone wanting to cloth diaper; even with the bulkiness for newborns I still think they work well and know they will work even better when my baby is a little bigger.",4

"3385","Teach Baby to Walk - Moonwalker -(Baby Walker Walk Assistant is fully Adjustable) Walk with baby device includes safety straps and adjustable baby toddler harness. (Walk Baby Moonwalk Version 2011).","Typically developing children have the physical and mental tools needed to teach themselves to walk given the appropriate environment: furniture or barre  to ""cruise"" along or a loving finger to hold if the child seeks one, for example.  This product can only obstruct a child\'s natural tendencies and give a false sense of accomplishment which could lead to injury when the child is released from this contraption.  Research consistently shows that forced early walking is not good for a child\'s physical or mental development and I cannot imagine what this could do to the child\'s spirit.  Again, I speak of typically developing children and realize that perhaps similar items are appropriately used under the instruction of trained physical therapist or occupational therapists.

They are great!!! Again for those that complain that they don\'t absorb urine..------- SWIM DIAPERS ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO ABSORB URINE!!! That would totally defeat the point of a diaper for swimming.  My boy did a number 2 only a couple of times and this swim suit caught it all just fine.  Nice snug fit and they wash incredibly well.  The velcro gets a little tattered, but honestly, for 8 months of weekly washing, they are so well made.  These are very appropriate for an infant/early toddler to wear alone without being bulky.  He received so many compliments on them.  He\'s now a bit bigger and wearing little boy trunks, but we put these underneath the trunks to catch any potties, because they will hold so much better than the trunks----they are that good!!

"3396","Leachco Back \'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I never got around to buying a pregnancy pillow with my first pregnancy but since I\'m already having a hard time getting comfortable in bed this time, I figured I\'d go with the big guns.  So I have nothing to compare to and while it\'s not perfect, it sure beats using multiple pillows and having to rearrange all of them every time I roll from one side to the other.  I don\'t at all find the seam to be a problem, something a lot of other reviews point out.  I do, however, find having to keep your bottom arm under the pillow a bit awkward at times.  I\'m not sure what the perfect design would be and may try this with the opening at top, using a regular pillow for my head so I have more freedom for my arms (with space between the pillow I use for my head and the one I use for my belly, etc.), but that is my only piece of negative feedback so far.  I love having both belly and back support - this keeps me from rolling onto my back and I think I\'ve woken up less since it\'s so much easier to roll from one side to the other, again, without having to rearrange a bunch of pillows. Also, I have a queen bed and this takes up just about half, so my husband has plenty of room.  It would work better with a king and I definitely wouldn\'t get it if you have a full/double, but a queen is definitely doable.  If you want belly and back support in one, this seems like just about the best all-in-one option out there.",4
"3397","Ergo Baby Carrier: Black-Camel","I was ready to purchase a Bjorn but then a friend of mine registered this for herself so I checked it out and found all the positive reviews. I ended up getting one for her baby shower and one for myself. My baby is now 3 months old and weights 16 lbs. And this is definitely great for me to use, I use it when I take her groceries shopping; since she\'s a winter baby the materials on the carrier keeps her warm & cozy without needing much else (other carriers out there don\'t seem to have as good of a coverage in blocking freezing wind) plus she is snug against me so my body temperture keeps her warm. She loves it and falls asleep in it. When she was a newborn in the middle of winter I would sit her low in the carrier so that her head doesn\'t poke out, on top of it I would use the hat to block the wind from blowing into the carrier.Since this product was built/design with much more considerations than other carriers, it is a bit more complicated and much more materials were used. My brother-in-law who is single & without kids says it seems too much trouble to put on and that when he has kids he\'d prefer the Bjorn for its simplicity. However, both him and my husband are tall strong guys (6\'1\'\' & 190 lbs); this carrier is great for me (5\'3\'\' & 120 lbs) since I\'m not strong enough to carry all of the baby\'s weight on my shoulders. The only down side is that this does not allow forward facing. For this reason along, my husband purchased a Bjorn so that he can carry the baby forward facing so that she can look out when we walk around the mall...however we limit the use of that to short length of time since we do have concern about the impact the Bjorn has on her developing spine.I have heard good things about the Belle Baby Carrier but are not sure if it\'s the exact same thing as the Bjorn- carrying the weight on the baby\'s crotch, if so then the Ergo is the best bet in ensuring your baby\'s weight is evenly distributed on his/her button instead of being suspended in the air by fabric across his/her crotch.",4

"3399","iBaby M3 Baby monitor for iPhone","Setup for this unit was fairly simple when only using it with an iPhone while on your own wifi network in the house. Setting up the software that came with it to view multiple cameras on a laptop was not very user friendly and seems like it requires far more manual steps and entries to get it to work than a modern unit of this cost should. Additionally, it constantly fails to connect and be viewable from a phone when you are outside of your own network. From everyone I\'ve talked to, you need to be fairly tech savvy and do more manual configuring with your router in order to get this to work for viewing from home on any consistent basis. All in all, not worth the cost for my intended use, and they still haven\'t come out for an app to view on android, nor will any of the apps I found locate these cameras.",3

Many public restrooms are questionable in their cleanliness (specifically, gas stations!), and big potties can be scary for little ones.  We didn\'t go anywhere without the stuffed in the diaper bag for the first 2-3 months we were potty training her.  It is bulkier than I was expecting, but worth the extra effort.

If you\'re looking for just comfort I\'d possibly say buy it but I\'ve slept on better. There are real thin parts in it so it doesn\'t have much support in certain areas, but in others it does.

This product certainly did the trick. The reason I\'m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because when we first got it, she found it a bit difficult to get the actual pacifier part in her mouth. This is because the paci is attached to a little piece of fabric (rather than directly onto the caterpiller), so it\'s wobbly. Now that she\'s older and has better dexterity with her fingers, it\'s no problem.

I love the size of the tub, as well as the drain and the extra little storage area at the end of the tub.  My 4-month old doesn\'t sit very well in the slanted part yet as his butt slides right off the bum-rest.  If that were a little bigger it would help.

I put a spoon of each, blended and voila!Yes i could take out a pot, steam, then take out a blender and have a mountain of dishes. Instead i just wash this...it is perfection!I must say i find the price steep. You can easily find a used one and that\'s the way to go.",5

It\'s also only in Celsius, which I realize the rest of world uses, but not here in the States. The delivery took forever, which is always a shock since I\'m so used to Amazon Prime.

"3437","HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn","With my first daughter, I used Halo Sleepsacks. Love them. I would consider myself a loyal customer of Halo. There are less expensive options out there but none as high quality as Halo, so I stuck with this company. However, I am very disappointed in the cotton swaddle sleepsack. When my second daughter arrived 3 months ago, I used SwaddleMes to keep her tightly swaddled at night. She\'s a big baby, so she outgrew even the largest size quickly. I found the swaddle sleepsacks and thought they\'d be perfect. She is 15 lbs and 26 inches long. I got the small size, it\'s supposed to be good from 13-18 lbs. The sleep sack itself fits well, but the swaddle wing is terrible! It is made out of a thin, stretchy cotton, so no matter how tightly I get it (and you can\'t get it very tight at all, trust me!) she can just move her arm up out. Also, it is sewn on poorly, so if she doesn\'t put her hands up, they are sticking out of the bottom flaps. This product has been much more frustrating than helpful. So now I am off to find something that will work.",NA

However even folded up its not that much smaller than a regular potty seat. It doesnt fit right on toilets. My son tried using it and before he even got up on the potty IT FELL INTO THE TOILET causing my son to fall and his whole arm went in as well. Maybe if it wasnt round and more of an oval shape it would work better. However it was a complete waste of my money. I\'m bringing his regular seat when we go on vacation now.",1

We do not load this baby up in the car and use it as our around town stroller, since the frame is all one piece it is super sturdy, takes some serious mileage, and is not small.  It does fold pretty flat, if you remove the wheels.  We have a two and four year old, they fit great, we got it when our two year old was a few months old and would wedge him in with blankets.  We have loved it!",5

"3445","UppaBaby Mesa Carseat (Jake)","I waited a while to write this review because I wanted to give this car seat a chance before passing judgment. I have officially been using it for 10 wks now and here is what I think.... I bought this car seat because of its safety features, simplicity of use, and sleek appearance. Some of the PROs with this seat are the look and ease to install and the ease of adjusting the straps but the CONs out weigh the PROS. Some of my cons with this seat are the sunshade does not provide enough coverage and has trouble staying open, it stains when it gets wet (you can wash it which I did however it is a pain), The &#34;one hand release&#34; from the stroller is not really &#34;one handed&#34; because the button is so difficult to push down ( and I am 5\'11\'\' 170 lbs I am not weak...). My daughter was 7lbs when we brought her home from the hospital and this seat was not comfortable for her at all no matter how we adjusted it. Now that she is 11lbs she fits much better and is more comfortable. The advertised spots to place the buckles that are supposed to keep them from getting hot and hold them out of the way are useless at this size because the straps are shorter and don\'t reach the slots. I see how once she is bigger and we have to let out the harness they will fit but they don\'t work right now.All of that I could live with the WORST part is (PLEASE READ!!!) I recently put the seat on the base in my car and for whatever reason I decided to rock the seat side to side to make sure it was clipped into the base and to my surprise it WASNT! Only one  side of the seat was latching into the base. So I pulled the seat out (took baby out) and turned it over. One of the silver latches that hook into the base was stuck up in the seat and wouldn\'t come out! I called Uppababy right away and the customer service was good They stated they would send me another seat. However it is 7 days later and no seat yet. Although they were helpful they are not quick.Overall, if I would have able to &#34;test drive&#34; this seat before buying I probably would not have spent the money.",2
"3446","Summer Infant Baby\'s Quiet Sounds Video Monitor","We received this monitor as a shower gift and I love having it for peace of mind.  When my daughter was a newborn I could take the monitor with me to any part of the house and see her.  Now it is in our room and we only turn it on if she wakes in the middle of the night but it is nice to know I can see that she is o.k..  With that being said, the sound is terrible so we don\'t use the volume since she is right down the hall anyway, the visual is actually pretty good on ours but it has a horrible bright light so we keep it turned slightly away so we can sleep.  We are expecting another baby and will probably buy another camera to watch different rooms.",NA

"3448","Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I\'m new to cloth diapering and have decided to do the good old fashioned prefold method.  So when I had to get the covers, I purchased a couple of each of the most popular brands, only going based on other people\'s reviews.  I absolutely love these Thirsties.  I have Imse Vimse, Little Beetle, Bumkins, and Kissaluv Wool covers along with the Thirsties.  So far, these are the only covers that are true to size and actually fit my daughter when she was a newborn.  My girl was 7lbs2oz when born and these covers were perfect for that time when you have to be careful of the umbilical cord.  I purchased newborn sizes in other brands and they were huge.  The thirsties fit right below her belly button to keep from rubbing up against it.  I haven\'t had any leaks or blow outs in these either, even with the explosive BM\'s that newborns have in the first few months.  Even when the prefold has been completely soaked, the cover has held up great.  The leg gussets are also a plus in preventing leaks.  I\'ll be purchasing more of these, especially since they\'re so inexpensive.Update after 6 months of use:These are still great economical covers, but they definitely don\'t go up to 18lbs.  My daughter is now 15lbs and is in the 50th percentile for weight and height, and she has just outgrown these.  But I must say that that isn\'t bad considering all of these sizes are approximate and most of the other covers I\'ve been using hasn\'t been even close to their size ranges.  She could still wear them just fine, but I\'ve moved up in size in her prefold due to blowouts for every BM she had, and the cover doesn\'t fit with it.  Still a great cover.  I\'ll just need to get the next size up.  But to use a cover, literally from birth to 6 months, is not bad for the price.",5

He not only loves the chair as much as I do but was very impressed with how secure the straps are (connecting to the chair and to the baby). I like the recline feature and the tray is easy on - easy off. We love this high chair and are glad we don\'t have to find a place for ""one more thing"" in the kitchen. Money well spent!!",5

"3460","Sleepy Wrap Baby Carrier -ORGANIC Natural","This is a nice wrap, though to be fair I haven\'t used any others. This includes the carriers which aren\'t wraps. My baby is now 7 months old, and I bought this while still pregnant. The best thing I\'ve used it for so far was when we were still in the hospital as well as when she was a newborn at home was for skin-to-skin time with her next to me in the wrap. It\'s comfortable, and she would sleep in it easily while I went about what I had to get done, or just enjoyed her next to me. I will warn you that I stopped using it because it seemed cumbersome to put on and I just stopped doing it. When I picked it back up, she got upset, and didn\'t want to use it at all. I\'d like to try it again now that she\'s bigger, and use it while she\'s upright, but still haven\'t.The money was well spent when she was cluster feeding day and night and I could just put her in the wrap and not hold her (and actually feed myself!) when she was teeny tiny. A great buy, just for that alone. I hope she takes to it when I try it again now, but she may not.",5

Too bad this design didn\'t come in cotton flannel. Also, I live in Hawaii, so the polyester would have been really hot on baby\'s skin - just needed simple cotton. I returned it.",2
"3462","Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","This product is great.  Worth the $30 for sure!  I bought it to use while on vacation with our 17 month old, who generally sleeps well through the night without any kind of sound machine device, but while traveling, she is easily disrupted by a new sleeping environment and sounds.  This machine has a continuous setting, as well as really nice soft sounds, like the ocean, or some classical music.  It also has a voice activation setting, to help console your child by adjusting the music volume, if you want to use it - but you don\'t have to.  It also has some fun pictures that are projected on the ceiling if you insert the accompanying little discs provided.  My only complaint, and it\'s a small one, is that I wish the small ""night light"" button on top that activates the actual night light on the bottom was not lit up.  My daughter sleeps better in complete darkness, and so it was easily overcome by just throwing a little towel or book over it.  That said, I understand to a certain extent that it\'s there so that parents can easily find it at night instead of fumbling in the dark when going to check-in on their little one.  Would highly recommend!",5

"3468","Chicco Liteway Plus Stroller, Equinox","This stroller makes my life so much easier. It\'s lightweight, folds up and down easily, and is super easy to maneuver! I don\'t like putting my car seat on a shopping cart, but I can maneuver this stroller with one hand no problem, so I just pull a shopping cart behind me in the grocery store. I get funny looks, but it works for me.  One of my favorite features is the attachable sun shade that covers baby completely in the carseat mode , and then later attaches overhead in toddler mode. It\'s big enough to actually block the sun. It has a little viewing window, but there is always a glare, so I\'ve never been able to actually see him through it - only downside I\'ve found. But it\'s easy enough to move the shade and get a quick glimpse through the side.I haven\'t used it as a toddler stroller yet because my baby is only two months old. But this is a smart piece of equipment. The toddler seat looks safe but roomy and comfortable too. And with the attachable shade it looks like it will be nice and cool.It\'s pricier than other strollers, but I can use this from birth until he doesn\'t need a stroller at all , so it\'s a better deal than buying two strollers in the course of time.It\'s not a jogging stroller by any means, but I definitely recommend it for anyone who uses it for everyday errands. It\'s a lifesaver.",NA

Even when he doesn\'t want to be in the Exersaucer he frequently walks up to it and around it to play with the various toys.

My husband took it off and tried to reattach it, but it fell off the window while he was driving later.  We haven\'t bothered putting it back up.

It rides so smoothly and turns so easily; my husband the gadget/gizmo junkie just loves using it.  The adjustable handle height is great - we\'re both 5\'8"" but we use it on the highest setting, as it\'s more comfortable for us.  The basket underneath can\'t be beat as it\'s not only large but easily accessible (with the seat - not so much with the bassinet).  The frame is lightweight and durable.  I get compliments and questions about the stroller wherever I go.  I also love that it came with the bassinet AND the seat.  My little one likes to see the world so we really only used the bassinet for a month or two - now we use the seat on the most reclined position, and will likely be moving it up to the middle position soon.

"3496","Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Walk-Thru, Neutral finish","These gates are very sturdy and good quality. It took some talent to get them mounted to our stairs as the stairs are tricky to mount to. It took a trip to the hardware store to get the right parts but that is not a gate issue. Once up and mounted, they are durable and the gate part seems to be safe when you push the gate down in the locking/closing spot. The gates are easy to open with one hand and a baby in the other.I didn\'t give 5 stars because both of the gates I ordered were TAN and NOT WHITE as described on Amazon description and on the box! We wanted white but oh well, too much trouble to send them back and try to get white and when the box says white, who knows if we would have ended up with tan again. So, it may be safe to expect tan.But, these do the job and I would recommend them. Baby leans against them and they don\'t budge. Other child swung on one of them and it didn\'t move an inch (that is not recommended).",4

"3500","Second Nature Portable Bottle Warmer","We recently purchased this to use on a trip (5-6 hours).  It made things much better.  We use the 4 oz.

It looks like there\'s still a lot of butane left in the thermacell cartridge, even after four uses.  You do notice a slight odor when using it inside the car, but it\'s not bad, and cracking the windows a little helps.Overall we were very pleased.  This will make shopping around town easier and not restrain us to three hours.  We\'re looking forward to using it on a short hike in the near future.  The transaction from BabyEarth was smooth and they shipped really fast!",NA
"3501","RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty","First of all, there are a few changes to the 2013 model which I did not anticipate until receiving the carseat. I was initially excited by the changes. They have updated the car seat so that it now is approved until 40 pounds rear facing, which I believe puts it on the same level as the highest weight available for rear facing, as well as 37.5 inches standing and 22.5 inches sitting. There is a marker on the box for how high 22.5 inches sitting is, and I was pleased to see how far that came on me sitting next to it, as it came very high up on me, and I\'m 5\'9&#34;. My son is tall for his age, so I\'m happy that he\'ll probably be able to sit in this carseat rear facing for an extended period of time. They have also kept the forward facing limits at 70 pounds, 50 inches standing, and 27.5 inches sitting. So this carseat should last for quite some time!The other significant change that I found on my carseat which was not found anywhere online, and that I was initially extremely dismayed about, is that they no longer manufacture the seat with rear facing seatbelt lockoffs. My car (a 2009 Honda Accord) does not have LATCH for the middle back seat, so I was looking for a carseat that had rear facing seatbelt lockoffs. Sure enough, we struggled to get the seat installed correctly on our own. When the seatbelt was tight enough not only was the whole carseat tipped sideways at an angle, but the seatbelt folded into a notch in the plastic of the seat, which reduces the strength of the belt significantly. I emailed Recaro\'s customer service quite frustrated about the change, as I was unable to get the seat safely installed in my car, and they were completely unhelpful. They basically said &#34;Good luck installing it correctly&#34; with no advice or feedback as to how it was incorrectly installed, even though I sent pictures. So my husband and I made an appointment to get the carseat professionally checked. They provided us with a lock for the seatbelt (Recaro also provides these for free according to the owner\'s manual) and were able to get it installed tightly enough with the seatbelt without the carseat tipping or the seatbelt folding into that notch.So, now that I finally have the seat installed correctly, I\'m thrilled with it. I love the high rear facing limits, as that was one of the primary reasons I purchased this seat. Britax seats are only rear facing until your kid\'s seated height is 17.5 inches, according to their website. That is significantly shorter than this seat! And it now has the same weight limit (although I\'ve heard that most kids outgrow their seats in height before weight). I also really wanted a seat that didn\'t need to be rethreaded to adjust the harness, and this one delivers! In fact, I wasn\'t clear on exactly how the adjustment worked when I purchased it; I just knew that it didn\'t need to be rethreaded. The harness adjusts by a little knob on the side, which slides the headrest and the harness up and down the seat. There is no need to choose a specific notch in the adjustment as it smoothly slides up and down the whole thing, so you can get the perfect setting for your kid. This is great as with our infant seat I always felt like he outgrew the smaller setting before he fit into the next setting up. This way I can slide it up a quarter of an inch when I think he needs it. No need to choose a preset height!All in all, I really like this seat. It seems more comfortable than his infant seat (a Chicco), it is well padded, it adjusts easily, it sits up really high so he can see out the windows while rear facing, and now that it is installed correctly it is very safe. It is very tall, but it fits fine in our 2009 Accord backseat. We didn\'t need to adjust the front seats at all, and I can still see over it out the window. It\'s also pretty narrow (but not super narrow). There is room to sit next to it. It\'s not spacious, but it works. And my sister-in-law\'s infant Peg Perego seat fits next to it when we want to transport both babies at a time.If you\'re wondering about a small baby in it, my son is eight months old and in the 85th percentile for height. He is on the lowest height setting without the infant insert. So I\'m glad we had the infant seat for the first 8 months of his life, but I think we switched him over at a good time; he just seems to fit better in this seat. We don\'t have the infant insert (you have to send away to Recaro for it, but I believe it\'s free), so I\'m not sure how a smaller baby would fit it in, but one definitely wouldn\'t fit without it.I relied on reviews a lot while making my decision, so I hope that this helps someone!",5

We got it way sooner than Amazon said, and she tried it out right away.  She loves this pump, so far no problems with it.  She has been pumping occasionally and says the speed and suction have nice ranges on it.  Also neither one of us thinks the pump is loud, it does make noise.  The only other thing is she did need to buy bigger nipple horns.  Other than that great product.",5

"3511","Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue","I remember back in my first trimester looking over Amazon.com\'s selection of maternity pillows.I am so glad I decided on this one.The fact that it covers your back and front is really nice.The back on it provides me with just a little bit of back support, but what a difference that makes! The very first night I used it it helped me so much in getting a good nights rest.Now I am 34.5 weeks with twins and get back pain when I try laying down without this pillow. With it there is NO PAIN! I have had an extremely easy twins pregnancy, and this pillow helped with that.Now I don\'t always get a good nights rest, but this pillow really has helped me. I sling one arm under the pillow, one over, I tuck the otherside into my back, and my head rests in the middle. When I need to get up (every 2 hours to pee) I simply kick the front of the pillow out of my way like a door, slide out of bed, and when I come back I just close the door again.It makes flipping over in bed easy to. I don\'t have to move the pillow to the other side of me, since both sides are identical. I have to flip over about 4 times during the night when my lower arm starts to go numb etc.This pillow could likely also be used a nursing pillow, but having twins I wanted a more sturdy twins nursing pillow.My hubbie loves this pillow to, and has stolen from me on occasion!The cover is very comfortable. I remember someone posting it was ""hot"". I don\'t find that to be really true. I mean it is as hot as a sheet would be, not like a blanket. And you don\'t really wear the body pillow on top of you, it is on the side of you.Anyway, I can\'t imagine a better maternity pillow, and although $50 seems like a lot to spend, it really has been worth it for me, and I\'m pretty dang cheap.",5

The minute I got it out of the box and put together he loved it and knew what it was and what it was used for (since it looks just like the one mom and dad use). He sat on it and flushed and pretended with it all day long.  We put it in the bathroom and within a few months he had completely potty trained himself with very little direction from us (lots of praise tho).  And I was dreading the whole potty training struggle thing!We never used the splash guard ( a real toilet doesn\'t have one so why should a trainer?) we just told him to point it down.  The only problem we\'ve had, if you want to call it that, is that once our son started using it standing up, it became a real hastle to clean when his aim wasn\'t so good.  Potty targets and bubbles fixed his aim real quick tho!I\'ve bought or recommended this potty to a lot of freinds and family members and all have had similar results.  Yes, it works flawlessly for girls, but is still an excellent potty for boys too.Its very sturdy (Easy to sit on, the hole is not too big or not to little, no tipping over, no wiggling parts while seated), easy to clean and since it looks like a real potty easy for the little ones to identify with.  As for the splash guard issue everyone seems to have a problem with,  just teach your son how to point it down, it\'s kinda a no-brainer. Most of the experts tell you not to use the splash guards anyway (they could injure your son and be a &quot;bad potty training experience&quot;).  Anyway if your son can\'t learn to point down, he\'s probably not ready for potty training, just my opinion.  This really is a great potty.",5

He\'s 32 1/2 inches and weighs 22lbs. He fits fine. Well worth the cheap price!This umbrella stroller has many great features for such a small stroller. First, the basket is functional. We have a BOB and a Perego, both have large baskets. This basket isn\'t that large, but it is big enough to carry things and is useful. Second, the stroller comes with a handle bar console. This is something you usually have to buy separate, as we did with the BOB. It\'s big, has 1 large drink pocket, 2 bottle pockets, and a covered center pocket for keys, wallet, etc. Very useful. Third, it\'s really light and easy to open and close. Forth, it doesn\'t recline a lot, but it\'s okay for short term (ie: Store, walks, Disneyland for a couple of hours).

Saw this thermometer on sale at Sam\'s Club, so I picked one up.  On the one hand, the temperature tends to read closer to what I expect it to read.It is tricky to use.  As other reviewers have noted, you have to start at about the middle of your forehead, slightly above eyebrow height, hold the button, then swipe sideways until you reach your hairline.  The trick is not to lift the thermometer from skin until after you let go of the button.I deduct a star because of the claim that all you need is a gentle swipe.  I find that when I use it, in order to make sure that the sensor remains in contact with skin at all times during the scan, I have to press it rather firmly against my forehead.  Maybe I just have a bumpy head, or rough skin.  Whatever the reason, &#34;gentle swipe&#34; is not the word I would use to describe the scanning process.

I was at my wit\'s end as my breastfed grandson, who I take care of five days a week, is just not doing well with Dr. Brown\'s bottles. He chews on the nipple and the breastmilk either runs out the side of his mouth or comes out of the nipple too fast for him to swallow. He gets a lot of air because the nipple does not fill his mouth. He also is not sucking as hard on the breast as he used to.In desperation, I tried Como Tomo and am absolutely amazed! The nipple is much more like a breast, and it took him twice as long to drink half as much milk, which is precisely what one wants for a breastfed baby. They need to work to get the milk, and they need to have a similar experience at the bottle and the breast.  I also really like the soft silicone bottle, because when he quits sucking, instead of moving the nipple around (which is annoying to him), I just give a tiny squeeze and a little more milk goes into his mouth and reminds him what he\'s doing.Como Tomo is the perfect solution for mothers who need to have caregivers feed their babies.",5

For the first three months I rarely let my little one out of my sight; he slept with us, we held him during the day, etc. Now he is sleeping in his crib for naps and at night- everyone is sleeping better. I credit a significant portion of my peace of mind to this product b/c it is so powerful I can actually hear him breathing through my receiver. Even with it set on the sound activation mode, the monitor periodically switches on and I can hear the little guy snoring. It is awesome! Highly recommended.",5

"3551","Baby Brezza Quick Blend Blender","Let me first say that it broke after 3 weeks. I smelled burnt plastic, and when I removed the top part, there was plastic saw dust under it.I bought this blender because of small size and good looks, and in spite one single-star review. Upon arrival it felt cheap, and did not sound right. The motor is extremely and unpleasantly loud, and lacks smoothness. For comparison: my Cuisinart blender is smooth, it sounds something like an electric drill. This thing, filled with banana or baked potatoes, sounded like a coffee grinder full of beans. It is really hard on the ears of everyone in the house.That said, it was easy to use and it did its job well. The shape works well for pretty much every kind of food, and it is easy to clean.When it broke, I felt sort of relieved and placed it right in the dumpster. I don\'t miss it at all. I bought the 1 1/2 cup Cuisinart mentioned above at a local shop and I\'ve been very happy with it.",1

"3553","Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center","We got this for our son when he was about 4 months old, mainly because he was only happy in the standing position and our arms were exhausted!  What a life (and arm!) saver!  My son was ALWAYS happy when he was in his walker.  The car was fun for him to play with, he was able to have some independance and what I loved was that the toy part came off, so he could have snacks on the go.  I actually fed him a couple of meals in this when he was just too fidgety to sit in the high chair.  The cushioned seat is realatively easy to remove (by an adult), so whenever needed, it could be thrown in the washing machine.  Now that our daughter is 4 months old, she\'s about ready to start hanging out in there (we\'ve got another one who\'s only happy when standing!).  I deffinately recomend this walker!",NA

"3555","Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor with 1.5 Inch Color LCD Screen","When my Sony Baby Call monitor started buzzing frequently and randomly shutting off I started shopping for a new monitor. I spotted the Motorola MBP20 and have been using it for about a week.PROS:Design - Nice visual design.Size - About the size of an iPhone, small and convenient.Weight - Light and easy to carry.Carrying Convenience - The belt clip can be rotated to function as a kick stand and is also removable.Screen - Small but gives a clear and crisp image, can be turned on or off so it doesn\'t glare brightly at night. The audio still works even when the video is off.Menu - Easy to navigate and change settings.Sound - The sound is clear and there is no static. I like that it is encrypted and secure.Battery - I use the monitor for about 7 hours total during the day and the battery is only drained about half way. I don\'t leave the video display on though. (Tip: On the battery itself is the suggestion to charge the battery at least 16 hours before using.)Price - I got this for 80. I consider that a great value.CONS:Night Vision - Image is ok, details are lost the farther you put the camera from the target area. I have two kids that share a room and I initially wanted to try to get a view of the whole room. The image is easy to see in the day but the night vision infrared bulbs only reach so far. As a result I had to put the camera closer to just one crib.Volume - The highest volume is about the same as noises in real life. I list this as a con because my old monitor\'s volume goes much higher. It was easier to wake up to at night.Voice Activation - This monitor has a feature that turns on the microphone when a certain noise level is reached. When the noise level is below that threshold the mic is off. There is no way to turn this feature off or adjust the sensitivity. I noticed the closer the camera is to the baby the higher the sensitivity and the more noises will come through on the monitor. (Tip: if you push the video on/off button you can activate the microphone and listen in on the kids.)Visual Sound Alert - My old monitor had lights that would flicker on when the monitor detected sound and the louder the sound the more lights would come on. This monitor does not have that feature and I regret that. It does however have an alert you can activate that will sound when the monitor is muted and detects noise.BOTTOM LINE:I would recommend this monitor. I mainly use it to hear when my 6 month old wakes at night and when she and my 2 year old son wake in the morning. It does the job for me and it\'s fun to see my baby on the video.",4
"3556","Arm\'s Reach Natural Original Co-Sleeper","This seems like it would be a sturdy baby bed, and even with the extensions does not seem wobbly.  The problem is that is does NOT attach to a bed with a frame.  This fact is not listed anywhere in their product description either here or on their main site.  It must be attached up against the mattress, and the legs do not allow it to get anywhere close, there is about a 5 inch gap left, too much to just pull the mattress over as I also have a memory foam mattress.  So I\'m left with a bassinet that is no different from any other bassinet attached above a play pen, at twice the cost.  The quality of this product is the same as any other name brand play pen, so nothing else justifies the extra expense if it cannot in fact be used as a co-sleeper with a bed on a frame.

"3561","The Safe Sippy 2 2-in-1 Sippy to Straw Bottle, Pink","So I researched far & wide and have a few hand me down sippy cups and decided to buy this cup.  even at 6 months my son seems to have an easier job using this cup, it\'s a lot smaller than it looks, which is good, he can hold it by himself and seems to be able to suck out the liquids with ease but no spillage.  I like that a straw comes with it for later, cover & the stainless / BPA free / dishwasher safe aspects not to mention it\'s ""cool looking"".  I do try to wash it after every use per other reviews, but just plan to buy a couple of them in different colors & put in dishwasher daily & rotate. I don\'t think any cup should sit out in water for a long time no matter who makes it / what its made of / how many parts & we take apart all his bottles so taking apart his cup for washing is not a big deal, doesn\'t take long at all.",5

Love that it folds so easily and, this may seem silly, but my favorite part is the release on the child restraint. One push on the center button and it releases. No more pushing separate sides to get my fussy granddaughter out of the carriage.The only down side to this stroller is because it is so light weight, hanging a diaper bag on it without the counter balance of the baby tends to tip the stroller backwards.Other people have complained about this being hard to steer with one hand, but I haven\'t had any problem with that. I have a 4-year-old granddaughter who insists on holding one of my hands when we\'re walking and this has proved to be a non-problem.Love my new stroller, would definitely recommend it.",5

The range is good too in the house or outside if you\'re on the porch, etc. The batteries don\'t last long, it eats them up fast so keep plugged in all the time or you\'ll go through batteries fast.The monitors light up with sound so that\'s nice. They will buzz if it\'s next to another plugged in device, like a cell phone, etc. So plug in your phn, device, etc then turn on the monitor and it won\'t buzz.

I used the lower attachment to hold the Britax Infant Car Seat when my youngest son was newborn (even a toddler since he\'s small for his age), and my older son rode in the front seat. I received many compliments any time we went anywhere with the stroller. It\'s nice that it\'s not wide like most double strollers, and I love the fact that it\'s so easy to snap the seats in/out and switch the direction the seats face. Now that my youngest is almost 2, he was too big for the infant car seat to be attached to the stroller so I went ahead and purchased the Second Seat for the B-Ready Stroller. It took me this long to buy it because we\'d already spent a lot on the stroller/car seat (although we did get a good deal when we originally bought it - the car seat & shipping were free).

It takes some coordination to lift both levers at the same time.  In fact, my husband and I have horribly enjoyed hearing our family go into the downstairs bathroom and have to call us to show them how to do it- all as they have to use the restroom.  LOL!  It is not permanent and doesn\'t seem to be leaving marks on the toilet or lid (of course, if you slammed it down really hard, you might get some marks under the toilet seat itself but we aren\'t the gentlest family and I don\'t see anything).  If you are a larger person, you might feel the outer part of the arm against your thigh even when it is open, but it doesn\'t hurt and we\'ve just pushed it towards the front more.

"3586","Summer Infant Quickchange Portable Changing Pad, Black","This is exactly what I was looking for: a simple, waterproof changing pad that you can plop down anywhere and turn any surface into a changing table! Our apt. is too small to fit a full changing table in our room with the limited space, so we needed something we could put on the bed or floor or wherever to make a changing space for our baby. This one works great for that purpose -- I love that it is waterproof so our bed is protected against spills and you can just wipe it off for easy clean-up. It is thin enough to be foldable and portable, yet padded enough to use on any surface (no, it\'s not as padded as a full changing table-top, but it\'s not meant to be one, either!). The only glitch I realized after using it a few times was that I have to keep a piece of cloth or folded diaper under my baby girl when I change her otherwise when she pees it puddles up under her and rolls all the way up her back! This issue is kind of unavoidable with any waterproof pad, though, and it still does the job of protecting the surface of our bed, which is what I was more concerned about to begin with.

"3594","JJ Cole Mode Diaper Tote Bag, Black Magnolia","With our first baby, we carried a small suitcase (essentially!) and everything but the kitchen sink. These days, with four kiddos in tow, I need my arms and strength for more important things besides hefting an unnecessarily huge and heavy bag with me, like keeping my three year old from feeding the baby nuts or running into the street. (I can spot a new parent a mile away by their huge, fancy diaper bag...)I thoroughly examined, held and even purchased some of the following: JuJu Be, Petunia Picklebottom, Skip Hop Duo, and one more I can\'t even remember. And guess what? If I had a million dollars to spend on diaper bags, I\'d still buy this slim little JJ Cole beauty. Why? Here are a few reasons:++Pockets galore! Inside and outside with lovely light liner inside to help make things visible. I never lose my keys now!! (Important because while I\'m looking for my keys, my darling three year old is trying to find a stick to scratch the next car over.)++Several choices for handle straps (length and location)++Awesome, slim, easily foldable with velcro changing pad. I actually use it because it\'s not like wrestling an octopus to get it back in the bag neatly (and I feel as though I can speak with authority about wrestling many arms at a time...)++The metal feet on the bottom...I don\'t know why I like these, but I do.++Stroller clips - GENIUS! Easy to put on my stroller, easy to attach to my diaper bag (easier than the skip hop, juju be clips)++The size. I looked for a long time to find the smallest diaper bag (I really read all the dimensions on the bags to make sure I wasn\'t getting a small piece of luggage) and this is slightly bigger than a big purse, but still smaller than any other diaper bag out there. It\'s like a Mary Poppins bag because I can fit everything I need, but it\'s a sleek little size.In short, I adore this bag and I\'m a diaper bag veteran and I really shopped around this time, but this is hands down the best for a fraction of the cost of many fancier bags out there.",5

Best of all, even though I had to move my son (1.5yr old) to the ""door"" position from the middle position b/c the two seats were too bulky to strap in next to each other in my Geo Prism, my kids can still hold hands and pass toys to each other.  We are happy (and presumably safe, too!).Two minor complaints: cupholder is a waste of plastic (and I\'m not fond of waste) and the crotch buckle has a perverse tendancy to fall backwards towards the back of the seat b/c both kids\' seats are tilted back halfway.  For my son, this is no big deal b/c I\'m still lifting him in and so forth.  For my daughter, we have the inevitable struggle to wiggle it out from under her bottom every time we get in.  I\'m thinking of attaching a velcro dot, so that it could be stuck to the seat where I want it to be...but then there\'s the possibility of wrecking tights and other girly clothes...we\'ll see.  Great seat.  Would buy it again and recommend to friends.",5

I don\'t like that you have to leave some of the bars to the crib exposed in order for it to fit tightly around the crib.  I don\'t like the fact that my daughter who is barely just now  able to move, is able to move the bumper down and get her legs stuck in the bars.  They don\'t put ties throughout the bumper for supposedly safety reasons, but I think they are needed in order to keep the bumper in place better.  I\'ve had the bumper for a week or less and will be returning it.  Save your money and get something else.",2

"3607","Britax Vehicle Seat Protector","We bought this seat protector for our Britax Marathon 70-G3. The whole purpose of this seat protector was to keep the indentations of this seat from ruining the leather on our car.The Good:So far the leather hasn\'t had quite the deep indentations that we were having before we used this.The Bad:This is way overpriced of an item! It is not nearly as thick as I thought that it was going to be. And even though the leather has not been indented yet, I\'m not sure if over the long run it will stay that way.We have our seat in the middle, and even if it were on the side, it still hangs over the seats next to it. Which is a big problem if you want other people to sit in your car. You have to maneuver your way around this protector to get your buckle in. That is not pleasant for visitors that are in your car.Overall, I\'m not sure that this product is worth the money and the hassle. I wish I had listened to some of the other reviewers and just laid a thick towel underneath the seat instead of this. I love Britax and their products but this one is not one that I would recommend. It is not nearly the same quality of product that I\'m used to Britax creating. Hopefully they will read some of these reviews and realize that they need to step it up and make a better quality item that is actually worth the price, instead of this cheap piece of plastic film.",NA

"3613","My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","On my second child I longed for more one-arm-free nursing. I have been using the Boppy prior to this. After a c section I thought this pillow would be helpful however I found the pressure from having to strap it on uncomfortable fir the ehole first month. Also I had become accustomed to having an arm support my baby while nursing and the design of this pillow doesn\'t work that way, your arm is to be a support over top of the baby. Nothing uncomfy but foreign to me and I don\'t like this pillow for that reason. I feel less close to my baby when using this. I prefer to hold my baby in my arm and support with a pillow. This functions to hold with a pillow and support with your arm. I wanted more freedom to move around while nursing but find using no pillow when moving to still be easier.In addition I enjoy using the boppy as a baby positioner, holding baby inclined after a feed to promote burping. I can\'t see how this pillow can do that.Good design, firm pillow, however if you\'ve used a Boppy this may just be too foreign.",3

No one has been able to diagnose exactly what it is, I have gone through multiple therapies, antibiotic rounds, steroid ointments etc. In short, I had come to terms that this pain will continue as long as I try to breastfeed/pump. Everyone had also suggested applying heat. Applying heat usually would take an extra 15 minutes before-after each pumping and feeding session that I did not have the time to dedicate to. I really wish I had found these much sooner, they worked like magic - so easy to use and you can wear them around the house. I have been feeling much better, my pain is 70-75% relieved.

I think the bottles do simulate breast feeding well, as our twins have no trouble moving between bottles and breasts. They do control flow properly, and I am happy with these. Also tried Playtex, and those don\'t restrict flow as much.We have 4 sets, and I have experienced issues with the product. Specifically:1. Inner nipple is unreliable-I have had the silicon of 6 inner nipples bend or form a bubble, making it useless. I am following the instructions and am cleaning them as instructed.2. The mixing lid-This is terrible. It does not close properly on almost any attempt. Basically, it will close unevenly, and then when you shake the bottle to mix the formula, it will leak out of the bottle slowly, which means milk will fly everywhere when you are mixing formula. Maybe 3 out of the dozen I have actually close properly.3. The inner/outer lid assembly-When you press the milk release tab lightly as instructed, the bottle will frequently have milk leak out the sides under the collar. This is extremely messy. There is also, almost always, some milk which will not drain out.",4

It is perfect for a newborn.  I also put my 11 month old niece in it (she weighs 19 pounds) and it worked wonderfully as well.  As long as you tie it tight enough around you, it should support your child and hold them close to you.  It is great to use to chase my 2 year old around in while still keeping baby close.  I have no complaints so far.  It does take a minute to get the wrap set up, but once its on you can just leave it on after you take baby out.

"3643","Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles","I purchased these bottles after hearing how wonderful they were. I breastfed my daughter for her first year, so we didn\'t use them that often. When she was weaned, and started on formula we started having problems. Everytime my husband or I would screw on the ring, milk poured out everywhere! There was no right way to screw the damn rings on... it was just pure luck, and it took numerous times each feeding to get it on right. The milk would pour out from underneath the ring (not from the nipple). My first thought was that I just got a bad batch... but I had bought them at different times, then I thought that the dishwasher was somehow warping them. Well, if that\'s the case then forget about Avent!! I don\'t have the time to handwash all her bottles, and if I did find the time, I still wouldn\'t.I read through the reviews to see if it was just me... I found many reviews just like mine. Then I found myself laughing at the reviews that instruct you on how to create the perfect seal. I gotta tell you, I put up with these stupid bottles for far too long, and they are expensive, so I held off on buying new ones. It felt so good to throw these in the trash. There is no need to have to spend the time on the ""perfect seal"", when there are other brands that work so much better! We finally threw them all out and bought another brand, Soothie, so far have been wonderful!Don\'t waste your money on this brand.*The sippy cups are just as bad.

"3651","The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","This stroller offered some good features, like the higher handle position and larger seat, but there were too many things that disappointed me. This stroller claims to have a recline feature, but it\'s more of a &#34;slouch&#34;. The back of the seat simply sags in when you pull a drawstring on the back. While it\'s nice to have a storage area beneath, the metal frame of the stroller makes it difficult to access it and you can only slide small objects in from the side. The front wheels also started squeaking loudly after a week or two of use. My biggest complaint, though, is the shade that comes with this unit. First, it is TINY and, if that didn\'t render it useless enough, it is also FIXED and has to be velcroed to the handles, or it swings down freely and will hit your child in the chest. You can\'t adjust the angle of the shade to protect your child from the sun, so it\'s completely useless. I had to purchase an additional sunshade that attaches to the one that came with the stroller and it is a pain to have to attach and break down multiple pieces each time I use this stroller.",2

I took a star off because some of the accessories that I thought was included was not but it still came with plenty.Other minor quibbles...  The included changing station is certainly strong and we use it almost exclusively now, but our baby at 5 months has almost outgrown it.

"3665","New Boba Wrap in Red with Matching Carrying Pouch : Infant Baby Carrier : Preemie - 18months (Previously Sleepy Wrap)","My first baby was born in December of 2012.  I was given two Moby wraps as gifts before he was born, and had even given a Moby wrap as a gift to a friend before I had a baby.  A few weeks after he was born I decided to try the Moby, I figured out the wrap part pretty quickly but I couldn\'t figure out how loose to wrap it to fit my rapidly growing baby.  After a few attempts I finally gave up.  After another few weeks I became really irritated by the fact that I had two perfectly good wraps, but that I didn\'t want to use them.  I contacted a woman in my town who sells all types of baby carriers (Frogmamma) and went to see her.  She showed me the Boba wrap, I fell in love.  It was the same type of wrap carrier that I wanted, but the material was stretchier (and softer to the touch) compared to the Moby.  You tie it so it is snug against your body and then put baby in, the material stretches to the perfect fit everytime.My son is now 5 months old and 16 pounds.  We still use the Boba wrap (I have two) constantly.  In those first few months it would help to calm him down during his fussy moments, which always happened in the morning.  This wrap allowed me to actually get breakfast while he would sleep.  I bought another Boba wrap and keep it in the center console of my car.  If I know in advance that I will be using it, I will put it on before leaving the house so I don\'t have to do it in the parking lot.  That is the only con about this type of baby carrier.

"3672","Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I have two of these wraps in white and one in storm cloud.  We cloth diaper our son full time, using a combination of Kissaluv\'s size 0 and prefolds.  These fit well over both kinds of diapers on the lowest snap setting, and fit my son\'s skinny legs well.  So far we have not had a poop blowout or a pee leak with the Thristies.  We have had other covers leak due to the size of the leg holes, but these fit him nice and snug.  They don\'t leave red marks, and I prefer the snaps over the velcro (I have one Thirsties duo with velcro) because they don\'t get stuck on things in the wash and I\'m sure they will last longer.  I don\'t have a problem with the snaps looking funny while on him.My son was 6 pounds 12 ounces at birth, and at two weeks he is 8 pounds.  These fit from the beginning and continue to fit his skinny frame without sizing the snaps up.  At this rate I can\'t imagine he will outgrow them much before the 18 pound mark, but all kids are different.  I can\'t comment on the umbilical cord cutout because we used disposables until the cord fell off at 4 days.These do fit a little different than the sized Thirsties covers, and I think those are a little more full in the butt.  Both covers fit well, and I would choose these because you get more bang for your buck.  It\'s nice only having to buy two sizes as opposed to four.  I bought more of these in size 2 for when he outgrows the size 1.  They wash up well and I have not had any issues with staining.Update:The only issue I have with these is the rise snaps not staying snapped during diaper changes.  They constantly come unsnapped, and I have one cover that won\'t snap at all on the medium setting.  I\'ve been told that Thirsties will repair the snaps so they work, but that involves sending them in and waiting for them to come back.  I don\'t have time to wait for that.  For this reason, the sized covers might be better.",4
"3673","BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active - Blue/Silver","I was attracted to this carrier by all the rave reviews on Amazon.  I like to hike, and live in a city where strollers are an inconvenience, so I thought I\'d give this a try.  I already have the original model, but this sounded so much better according to other reviewers.  After using it for three weeks, my opinion is that this carrier is a slight improvement over the original when it comes to back support, but it\'s not a real carrier for truly active pursuits, and not worth the extra 90 bucks (or more) to buy it if you already have the original.Problem 1Although the lumbar support is a good idea in theory, I find that in order to get it to work, I have to tighten the attached straps to such an extent that my internal organs get squashed.  I\'m 5\'9"", 160 lbs, and I don\'t have a huge gut, but the lumbar just isn\'t tight enough against my back to provide support unless everything else in front is compressed to an uncomfortable degree, making it hard even to breathe sometimes.Problem 2An additional problem that I have found is that my child tends to sit considerably lower than in the original.  He\'s 5 months old, and over 26 inches long, but unless I set the seat at the highest point (for children between 21-23.5 inches), he simply sits too low on my chest, and he still easily (and painfully) puts his little heels into my crotch on a far too-frequent basis.Problem 3The little flap at the front of the carrier, which can be folded down when the child is facing forward, constantly pops back up from the folded position to bop my kid in the face.  There is no way to snap it or velcro it down, and the tensioner straps designed to aid in holding the child closer to your chest are insufficient to keep it lying flat once folded.Problem 4The shoulder straps are insufficiently padded, and as far as I can tell, have the same amount of padding as the original version.  My kid is only 18 lbs, and after an hour or so, my shoulders sometimes get sore.  I only wonder what hauling around a 25-pounder would be like.Problem 5The build quality on this carrier seems inferior to the original.  On my second use, the red bracket that receives the red insert of the outer carrier partially tore free of the stitching, requiring me to take out dental floss and needle to stitch it back up.Problem 6Even when properly strapped in, I find that my son still bounces around and his back is too far from my chest for this carrier to be considered suitable for anything more ""active"" than a brisk walk.  I have used it once to port him along for a mild hike, and felt that he simply wasn\'t sufficiently supported.  I don\'t find this carrier\'s snugging system to be better in any way than the original.ConclusionAlthough this carrier is marginally easier on your back than the original, it is not adequate for more than extended brisk walks.  If you don\'t have either carrier, it makes sense to get this one if you\'re particularly worried about your back or will be carrying a heavier child.  If you\'re simply planning to carry your child around town for a few hours, the cheaper original model is sufficient.  I am still waiting for a baby product company to offer a front-carry model for smaller children that incorporates backpack-style padded and contoured shoulder pads and a padded hip/lumbar belt capable of transferring weight from shoulders to hips.",3
"3674","Bright Starts Pretty in Pink Put and Take Purse","My 11 month old just loves this purse.  She plays with this constantly taking out the items and putting them back in.  It is also a plus that she can chew on them while taking them in and out.  Love that this purse is opened at the top as she loves to put other small toys in there as well as there is plenty of room.This is a great design compared to an older one we had for our other daughter who had such a hard time opening the purse and getting her fingers stuck, believe that was a sesame street purse not by Bright Start.",5

We now have it set up inside the dog door so that the dogs can come in the AC and go out with no problem and it blocks them off from the rest of the house. I love this Play Yard... It\'s been a complete life saver and the baby isn\'t even here yet. It comes put together so it\'s easy to set up and easy to add the extensions.

"3688","Eddie Bauer Harness Buddy, Monkey","First of all, I would like to start by saying that this harness is not meant to be used as a leash.  Some other parents wrote in that the tail is too short or that they felt like they were neglecting their child.We have twins who are 20 months old.  This harness has been a lifesaver.  We put on the harness when we go walking in the neighborhood or walking in the mall.  The kids still hold onto mommy or daddy\'s hands, but we wear the tail on our wrists.  As you know, toddlers may decide to let go and run for it without warning, and we have been able to keep them from running too far away in public.  Also, when 1 adult is out with the twins, it is hard to constantly hold both hands 100% of the time.  For example, when you reach into your purse to pay for something, which of your 2 hands are you using to hold the hand of each twin?  We tried the Kiddopotamus safety harness which was far inferior to this product, had Velcro fasters that easily became undone as the kids were running away from us.Initially, I did not think of purchasing a safety harness.  Then, one day, as I was driving home from work, I saw a mother with a baby in a stoller and a 2-3 year old holding on to the mom.  Then, when the light turned green to cross in the crosswalk, the 2-3 year old darted diagonally across the intersection.  The mom left the baby stroller in the crosswalk and ran after the little kid.  Thankfully, the kid and baby were fine.  If the mom had had a safety harness on her toddler, I\'m sure the toddler wouldn\'t have be able to run for a block and a half before mom caught up with her.",NA
"3689","Safety 1st Nature Next 3-in-1 Potty","I bought this for my almost two year old daughter and when it came time to train her to use it created such a mess.  The front lip that is supposed to help keep fluid inside the potty isn\'t quite large enough, or maybe not the right design for this.  Instead as she went potty everything splashed off of it causing an even bigger mess.  Because it was making such a mess she became scared of it and will not even sit on it now.  I mean it really went everywhere.  All over her legs, the sides of the potty, the floor, etc.  I\'m pretty disappointed because I think this has set us back a few weeks since now she is completely discouraged.",3
"3690","South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","I bought this table apprehensively, since many reviews talk about damaged parts and difficulty putting it together. It arrived completely intact, packaged well, and while a little annoying to assemble, came together quite easily (my 7-month-pregnant self plus husband put it together in less than an hour). Since the baby arrived, we have used it multiple times daily, and it\'s stood up very well to a squirmy, inquisitive baby.It looks great in the nursery, and for a piece of DIY particle-board furniture, it\'s quite sturdy. The drawers track well, access is easy (we put in a fewBadger Basket Folding Nursery Basket/Storage Cube, Sage Dotin it), and it does everything we need it to. I chose this design over other open changing table designs, since I didn\'t want objects on shelves floating around for the baby to grab. Now that my baby is mobile and enthusiastically grabbing at everything in reach, I\'m very glad of my decision.",4

Real people don\'t actually still USE those do they?!? I think they just still put them in movies so the bad guys can break in the door more easily!These brass locks should be on EVERY one of your exterior doors. They\'re easy and fast to install and you can put them nice and high so your little darlings won\'t open the door to strangers (in spite of the fact that you\'ve told them NOT to at least a bazillion times!). They\'re incredibly inexpensive, they\'ll last forever, they\'re not a bit unattractive ~ gosh, what more do you want?!? You might have to get a little more creative with a door with a window in it, but, other than that, this goodie is just that. Years ago, they used to make one exactly the same except that it was portable ~ instead of screwing into the doorframe, it had an extended piece of the brass that hooked over the ""stop"" on the doorframe (that\'s the piece that goes all the way around both sides and the top to stop the door when you close it). You simply took it wherever you went and put it on the door to keep your family safe and sound. (And if anybody ever finds any PLEASE let me know (through here) and I\'ll be eternally grateful!!!)",5
"3696","Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Warmer","I purchased this the First Years Baby Pro from the store because it was the only warmer available at the store with a water storage tank and I thought it would bring bottles to room temperature just fine.  I am using disposable liner bottles (Playtex Dropins).  On the freezer setting (even though I had refrigerated milk) and on a setting with more ounces than were actually in the bottle, it did not even take the chill off of the breastmilk and didn\'t seem to do anything to the formula bottles.  I ordered Dr. Brown\'s Bottle Warmer and it is much, much, much more superior - get this warmer!!!  It may not be as good looking but it has the water tank too and works perfectly.  Mainly, Dr. Brown\'s allows you to set the time - it only takes 3 min to get my bottles to room temp. and this warmer was running for at least 4 min with no progress.  The only slightly negative thing is there are 5 beeps when the warmer cycle is complete and there does not seem to be a way to turn off the sound.  We live in a small house and I don\'t want to disturb my husband in the middle of the night.  The noise is not too loud though and the product works so well, this is one minor thing and not a ""real"" problem.  I will note this warmer works great with the Playtex Dropins ORIGINAL nursers - do not put the premium nursers in here - it will melt them.  Based on my experience, the premium nursers will melt in any warmer - they look nice but are not very practical since they are so thin - plus, I prefer the tops on the original nursers!",5

I ordered this in plenty of time, let it expand and then further blew it up and tried it out. It was a little difficult to collapse back down and fit into it\'s little bag, but we managed. The trip was a success, my 4 year old went from a full car seat to a booster safely, and we travelled across the country with one checked bag each and all our necessities. Thankfully the airlines did not lose my bags on this trip as I didn\'t have room in my carry on for this rolled up car seat plus my son\'s other gear. Great purchase!",5

This product seemed to be the cheapest of all of the similar type products out there.  I really like it so far.  I haven\'t had any issues with it falling down.  I have a smooth tub so that probably is part of the reason it stays up so nicely.  It holds a good amount of toys, I have a couple of barbies, a set of foam shapes, a turtle temperature tester, a couple of rubber duckies, a few squirters and then a couple of soft sponge type toys in it.

"3712","Peg Perego Primo Viaggio Infant Car Seat, Kiwi","I love this car seat! It looks and feels sturdier than any other car seat I\'ve seen. I love the extra protection around my baby\'s head. Love the cushion around the straps. Love the newborn cushion; my baby sat up very well in this seat from day one leaving the hospital (we did use a rolled blanket around his head for the first few weeks, but I think all newborns need extra head support in any car seat). Love that the harness can be adjusted without rethreading. Love that the handle can be pointed down to keep the car seat from rocking when on a hard surface, if needed. The stylish colors are a great plus too (we have tropical)! Highly recommend!ETA: It\'s March 2014 and I\'m coming back to edit my review now that we have used this seat with baby #2 for 4 months. We used it with baby #1 until he was 11 months old (too tall). The fabric held up beautifully and looked like new for baby #2 (granted #1 didn\'t spit up in it EVER, and wasn\'t a drooler...unlike kiddo #2. ahem.). The newborn cushion is nice for catching the spit-up that seems to constantly pour forth from my sweet, adorable daughter, and it is easy to remove and wash (and holds up well in the washer and dryer). The buttons on the handles that you have to push in are a bit ""sticky"" now and usually have to be pushed several times before you find that ""sweet spot"" so that they will both go in and you can change the handle position. This wasn\'t a problem the last time we used it, and I\'m not sure why 3 years of storage in our climate-controlled closet would have caused it. Still love the seat, but the finicky buttons this time around are extremely annoying.",5
"3713","Britax Advocate 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","My 2 year old has had the Advocate in Onyx for about 2 years now. I love it. Feel very safe, it\'s incredibly sturdy. She rear-faced until she was a little over 2 years old (30 lbs and 36 inches) and only turned her around because she wanted to be able to see out the windows. What I love about it:- high weight and height limit. Chose it because of the high rear-facing weight limit.- so easy to adjust the straps - no re-threading required.- can remove all of the cloth easily to wash.- very simple to install.Only con for me is that the size of the car seat prevents us from having another seat adjacent to it (in our 2011 Camry). Obviously not a huge concern to me because I just bought a new one in Serene for my 7 month old son. If we have another child though, we\'d have to get another vehicle (or different seats).One reviewer said they can fit the seat plus two adults in the back of their Camry. I am not a heavy woman, but it would be a tight fit for me to fit next to the seat. It certainly cannot fit two heavier adults, or two adults comfortably, next to the seat in my opinion. I believe the same reviewer said he didn\'t think his wife could install this because of the size. Just wanted to say I\'m a female and have no problem installing the seat. It is heavy and I wouldn\'t want to take it in and out of the car daily, but I have no problem doing it when riding in a friend\'s vehicle.",5

I like the fact that it can begin as a play mat and then keep growing with the children.  I have a six month old and a two year old. What two year old does not love ball pits?Pros- It was really easy to set up.  It is really easy to  put the gym part on or take it off.  I loved that the balls can be placed in the turtles head for storage. I also like that my six month old gets lots of hand eye coordination from this gym.  With my two year old we work on sorting the balls by colors or counting them as we clean up.Cons- The foam tubes were really hard to put in.

She has also enjoyed chewing on these (while teething) so we will need a new set pretty soon!  I wish they had lowercase letters too!",5
"3725","Thudguard Baby Safety Helmet - Blue","I bought the Thudguard for my 7 month old foster daugther. We have very hard unforgiving floors. Within minutes of putting on the Thudguard she pulled herself up on a tall stool and fell back from a standing position smacking her head on the ground and pulling the stool on top of herself. She cried briefly, but when I took off the Thudguard to check her head there was no evidence of her fall. She is a very active baby and has taken many other falls and each time the Thudguard has prevented injury. It fits well and is easy to put on and off. Well made and easy to clean. When it is hot her head can get sweaty.",5

Safe, just enough light, lasts all night. HOWEVER, the charging station is terrible! It is very touchy  even when new. You have to get it on just so. Over time, it becomes harder and harder to get the position ""just right"". Ours is still pretty new and sometimes it takes me 10 minutes to wiggle it into the one perfect spot where it will charge.Before I purchased our Tyke Light, I read several other reviews that mentioned this problem. It is not just a problem with a few ""lemons"", it is a design flaw, and all lights will eventually stop charging.My daughter has the Munchkin puppy light, and it charges great. I would actually like the tyke light a little better than the munchkin if it were not for the issues with the charger. While it will take a charge it\'s awsome!",3

I looked at several of the clip on styles but the reviews were so mixed and it seemed like they wouldn\'t work a lot of the time.  If you don\'t know what the table setup is ahead of time you could arrive at your destination and be unable to use your chair.  This booster seat works everywhere, in booths and on all chairs.  It\'s also so much more comfortable and supportive for your little one while still being very portable.  I love that this one has a tray so I know my son has a clean surface to eat off of and I don\'t need to worry about him grabbing things off the table.  It\'s also great for containing food and makes it easier for younger ones who use the lip to pull food against.  Make sure you get the deluxe model if you want the adjustable height feature.",5

Then, almost as if she had sensed a disturbance in the force, her eyes would pop open and she would wail until we moved her directly into bed with us. To be fair, I think she would have done this with any co-sleeper. Maybe other mamas and papas out there would have better luck with this co-sleeper. As for us?

I have the Graco Cubby Parade Pack N Play and figured the sheets would be good since they\'re manufactured by the same company. Boy was I wrong. They don\'t fit the pad very well regardless if it\'s laying flat for the playpen or if it\'s set up for the bassinet. Since the bassinet is 3/4 the pad folds up and the sheet doesn\'t stay put very well at all. They are also cheaply made. Thin isn\'t even the word. It\'s upsetting that my Babies r Us only carries this brand. I\'m going to return the rest for a store credit and try to find a suitable replacement elsewhere. As for now I am currently using my bassinet w/o a sheet. The pad wipes down well and if i\'m going to have my daughter in there for a long time I use a waterproof pad under her. Since she\'s always wrapped in a blanket she doesn\'t mind going w/o the sheet.",NA
"3753","Graco Snugride Infant Car Seat, Platinum","Ugh. I registered for this car seat because it was simple - why are so many baby items covered in loud ugly patterns? I digress. I chose this car seat because it looked nice.And it does look nice! It also does a great job of keeping my little one snug when we go for a ride. And it fits on our old secondhand Baby Jogger stroller base.But man, I really wish I had bought one of the bigger versions. This is the Snugride 22, in case that\'s not obvious from the product details. Graco also makes a 30, 32, and 35, representing the maximum weight each car seat will hold. I glossed over all the numbers in my pregnant state, having no idea they would actually be important.My baby is now 4.5 months old, 15 lbs, and 25.5 inches tall (he\'s exactly average according to the growth charts). For the past few weeks it\'s been a real struggle to get him strapped in (especially with a winter coat on), and the harness seems way too tight. I adjusted the straps to their maximum length and have been wondering why it hasn\'t solved the problem. Only yesterday did it occur to me that he was actually getting too tall for the seat!Short version: knowing what I know now, I would have gone for a larger model to get a little more time out of the infant seat before having to buy a new one.",3

"3755","Philips AVENT Microwave Steam Sterilizer","My wife has been breast feeding our son since his birth this past January.  So when he doesn\'t eat directly from the breast, my wife will pump and store the milk for a later time.  Well storage containers and bottles need to be sterilized for sanitary reasons. This product by Philips AVENT is a good product for this task.It should be noted that all the bottles and breast pump we have is by Medela and there was a concern that they won\'t be compatible with this steamer.  However, the Medela bottles fit fine into this steamer.  This was nice because up until we received this steamer we were using the steam bags by Medela.  These steam bags are nice but only have expiration, 20 uses a bag.  This steamer omits the aspect of buying bags.In addition, the bottles can stand up nicely in this steamer which allow for an even distribution of cleanliness.  The one negative aspect is this steamer is promoted as portable and that is a subjective statement.  The steamer isn\'t too big or heavy and it can be easily transported.  However, we were in a hotel recently and the microwave was too small to accommodate this steamer.  Most hotel/motel microwaves aren\'t all that big, so one might want to hang on to those microwave steam bags.  Overall this is a good product and easy to use.",NA
"3756","Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat","I love this item. Of course not everything works for everyone, as a new Mom I found this out quickly.  But, this has been a life saver for me.  I purchased this when my daughter was 7 months.  She loved to take a bath but tried to lung across the tub for toys, the faucet or just for fun.  A wet, soapy, squirmy baby is very hard to handle.  With this tub seat, I can play with my daughter while she is in the tub, we are both more confident.  The seat allows you to put  more water in the tub to keep baby warm.  Plus it works great on my jacuzzi tub which is a deeper and wider than a traditional tub.  I highly recommend this item.  Purchase at Babies R Us and keep the box, try it if it doesn\'t work for you they will take it back!  My daughter is now 9 months about 18 pounds.  I have not had any of the problems some of the other reviewers have had.",5

"3760","Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers","I received the dual sounds and lights monitors at a baby shower before my daughter, Sophie was born (now 3 months).  I loved that it has two receivers.  We keep one upstairs and one downstairs so one will always be handy.  Yeah I agree with some of the others who say there is static, but for the price I think it\'s still a great deal.  We typically place the monitor where it can be seen(with volume all the way down), turn it on and glance at it ever so often while we watch television or whatever else we happen to be doing.  If we see the lights go up and get brighter we go to the monitor, turn the volume up and then decide what needs to be done next.  However I do not use the monitors while I sleep.  I am close enough to her that I can hear her.  I definitely recommend this on amazon.com and to my friends.  Again I say for the price it\'s a GREAT deal, if it had cost $100 or more yeah I\'ld be mad that is wasn\'t perfect. . .but I am 100% satisfied and pleased",5

He is in his late 60\'s and the two of us had the bed together in less than 30 minutes.The directions are clear and easy to follow.The bed is sturdy, doesn\'t have casters on the bottom, but that\'s only a minor issue. I bought the cherry bed, and the color is so pretty. I love the modern look of the bed. You can see the screws, because this bed doesn\'t come with the  little circle thingies you can pop in to cover them. It doesn\'t really take away from the look of the bed, though,and will make it easier to disassemble when you convert it to a toddler bed later.I\'m really happy with this purchase, and know I will be using this bed for years to come as a toddler bed, and later as a full-sized bed.",5

The sheets are designed by moms and made with quality jersey knit that easily stretches to cover the whole mattress without misshaping the pad, plus the sheet won\'t slip off of the corners accidentally.

As long as you let it set and don\'t try to remove and re-apply it works great.  My little guy can peel it off once i tried to move it, but the ones i left alone stayed on great.  I put it on all of the sharp edges around the coffee table and along book cases or furniture with sharp edges.  It\'s given me peace of mind as he learns to get more steady on his feet.  I wish i could cover the entire house in it.",4
"3776","Summer Infant Little Looster","My 17 month old daughter started showing interest in using the potty and did amazingly well in the first weekend. This left her father and I scrambling to find potty training tools before she lost interest due to frustrations. Like most toddlers, my daughter wants to do things for herself...even when she can\'t. One issue was the want to sit on the big toilet like everyone else.  Well, after one quick dip of the toosh in toilet water she feared it. So we opted for the Mayfair 83EC 000 NextStep Built-in Potty Toilet Seat with Easy Clean and Change Feature (also available on Amazon). Second issue is she wanted to be able to get up and down as she pleased. Our normal step stool, though very sturdy, didn\'t provide the surface area and height for her to achieve this. The Looster Booster was the perfect solution. Not only did it provide ample surface area to get on and off the toilet from any angle, it is very sturdy. The height is the best I\'ve found. Though her legs don\'t touch when on the toilet, it is still high enough for her to get on and off with ease. The only reason I\'m not giving it 5 stars is because it isn\'t wide enough for her to pull her pants down and turn around without falling off. But in all honesty, it would be a HUGE piece of furniture in our bathroom if it was wider. Good product! Great aid in potty training! We received our package in a day and a half, Super fast shipping!",4

It\'s the perfect size so he feels nestled in and cozy. I feel at ease knowing he\'s on his back but propped up just a little in case he spits up. Plus he doesn\'t like being flat on his back yet anyway. The music and other sounds along with the rocking make it easy to soothe him to sleep. I just lean over from my bed and turn it on. It shuts off automatically so I don\'t need to worry about that. He\'s also now enjoying the mirror and mobile overhead, so he\'s perfectly happy in the swing when he\'s awake too.

I really think the people that said it has no support forgot to put the board under the matress, that part does look like it could just be part of the packaging, so be careful not to throw it away. It\'s also much bigger than I though it would be, which is great! My only complaints would be that the stickers that label the parts are hard to get off and the wheels were hard to get on, my very strong husband had a very hard time with them, this is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. Besides all that though, I spend about 18 hours researching different bassinets and picked this one because it seemed sturdier than all the others I looked at because they all seemed to have cardboard supports, which freaks me out. Also it looked like a cradle (sort of) but cost less and even some of the cradles I looked at had a cardboard support! I also really like that the animals can be seen from the inside so the baby will have something to look at, not just some blank wall of wicker or plastic like others had. Oh, and the sheet it comes with is SOOO soft! I would really reccommed this, it is just perfect!",4

I remember being HORRIFIED of falling into the toilet when I was little and thought maybe he was having the same problem. I sent this to them thinking it certainly wouldn\'t hurt. He did a complete 180 after just trying it once! Apparently he was scared of falling in. The toilet seat gave him all the confidence that he needed! He is now a ""grown up potty"" veteran. He\'ll even use toilets out in public without the potty seat (something he out and out refused to do before). The only problem they are having now is trying to get him to use the toilet at home without his potty seat. Every time I talk to him on the phone he says ""Aunt Dawn! Thank you for the potty seat! I had cheese today."" or some other totally random follow up thought. I will probably forever be ""Aunt Dawn- giver of potty seats"" to him. I\'m okay with that title. :)",5
"3788","BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue","My son hated this bib. He is into mushing anything and everything into his face and when I put this bib on him, he did just that.

In addition the ability to add other toys to the set works just fine.",5

She\'s now 26 months and throughout this time Sophie got about the same amount of use which was little to none.  My daughter liked it at first but just for an hour, after that it went into her pile of toys.  She never used it to chew on or carried it anywhere.Overtime it has faded and all the spots are off which was a huge disappointment considering the cost of this teether.  She occasionally picks it up now and makes it squeak and brings a smile to her face then it gets tossed aside again.  There were many other much cheaper teethers that she had which she used a lot more.",3

"3797","The First Years Ignite Stroller","I recently purchased the First Years Ignite (Black/Green) for a trip across the country (Boston to Los Angeles). I currently own the Chicco Keyfit 30 Travel System and like that stroller very much, but it definitely is not appropriate for traveling on a plane.The price of the Ignite is not too bad for a travel/umbrella stroller. I was willing to splurge more on a second stroller that wouldn\'t kill my back, as many cheap $20 umbrella strollers tend to do. The height of the Ignite is great - I\'m 5\'10"" and my husband is 6\'2"" and we both were able to push the stroller without hitting our feet on the wheels. The \'basket\' is minimal but held some basic items. I usually draped my diaper bag over the handles but had to remember to take it off before taking out my son or it would tip.My son is 10 months, 20 lbs and 30"" and he fit in this stroller very well with *plenty* of room to spare. He didn\'t seem as comfortable as he usually does in the Chicco, but unfortunately some comfort is sacrificed for both price and the ease of travel. He liked to play with the shade a lot, and we usually clipped some toys onto the straps to keep him entertained.Speaking of the shade, it\'s minimal. We were on the Santa Monica Pier during his second nap and unfortunately this stroller did nothing to help him get out of the sun. We resorted to taking a jacket and draping it over the front so he could sleep. I\'ve read that there are shade-extenders that you can buy but unfortunately I didn\'t get one. The reclining seat - nothing fancy. Simply a drawstring that moves maybe 6 inches allowing for a reclined position. The cup holder and pouch by the handles - again, nothing fancy but definitely convenient. Can hold your phone and keys and a large drink.When traveling on an airplane, we took the stroller through security (it has to go through the scanner on the belt but its folds up very easily and has no problem fitting) and then checked it at the gate. I purchased theJL Childress Gate Check Bag for Car Seats, Redafter previously usingJ.L. Childress Gate Check Bag For Standard and Double Strollers, Redand having it hold up well. Again, this bag was great at keeping the stroller clean and allowing us to easily find it amongst other bags.Overall, I would recommend this stroller to everyone looking for a mid-range travel stroller, especially if you are tall.",5
"3798","The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","We use this stroller almost daily. Super affordable. Hot glued some cute patches on the shade/hood to customize. Daddy appreciates its sleek black styling better than traditional cartoon patterns. Started using when our baby was just a week old and still going strong 5 months later. Holds up to 50 lbs! Only complaint is that the hood doesn\'t completely shade baby\'s face and doesn\'t seem to be adjustable downward.",4
"3799","Munchkin Two Snack Catchers, Colors May Vary","Perfect size for my 14-month old. He has no problems getting snacks of all sizes out the top. Only complaint is that I ordered the orange and blue, but ended up getting orange and bright pink ones!",5
"3800","Mother\'s Milkmate Breast Milk Storage Rack (10 Bottles)","I worked extremely long hours, and sproadic days after my son was born. My current schedule is Mon, Wed, Fri, and weekends as needed. So remembering milk and keeping up with it was very important!I also had a HIGH supply. I\'d often have 10 bottles of SPARE milk in less than a week\'s time!This system really worked well for me. It was easy to grab X ammt of bottles for my son to take to daycare, or for his dad to feed him. Once the rack started to get full, I could easily pull out the extra milk and pour it into freezer ziplock bags to store.I never had any trouble with leaking, but you do need to be cautious to get the lids on properly. the threads are thin, so if you rush you can mis-align them. I love the medela solid caps, but eventually they leaked on me...these never did, long as I paid attention and screwed the caps on properly!They can be a pain to clean compared to a solid lid, but they didn\'t break down after over a year of heavy use for me, and that speaks volumes!The only regret I had was not buying MORE bottles...I definately needed more than 10!!I\'m currently pregnant with my second, and if i\'m to continue working, i\'ll definately be buying more bottles and using this system again :)",5

"3803","UPPAbaby Rumble Seat","I have 2 girls almost exactly 2 years apart, and got this to add to my 2009 Vista when the younger was born.  I was skeptical about how much use I\'d get out of it, and whether my older daughter would object to being in this seat, but I can say I am happy with the amount of use I\'ve gotten out of the Rumble Seat in the last 18+ months.  It was less useful with the carseat adapter, but got to be really handy when younger sis could go in the regular toddler seat. So many options- sometimes the little one would be in the ergo and I\'d use the Vista as a single, or we\'d roll with it as a double. Once I got the hang of it, I could snap the rumble seat on and off in 30 seconds.Now, I have 2 walkers, and we don\'t use a stroller quite as much as we used to, but my 3 year old still likes to hop in the rumble seat and have a snack when she gets tired.  The girls prefer riding facing each other-- they don\'t seem to be bothered by the one having her feet in the other\'s face.  Sometimes they trade places for fun.  My older is super tall (38"") so took the sunshade off ages ago, and just use the seat without it. I don\'t miss it.Even with the second seat the stroller handles better than most full sized singles. Be careful that the foot rest is properly attached to the bars(it stays there even if the seat isn\'t on) - I got lazy and left the velcro undone and the basket ripped from the weight of the rumble seat occupant\'s feet.Would I do it all again?  There\'s a bunch of cool doubles out there now (like the city select) and so maybe my decision would be harder now.  Also, if you have 2 kiddos riding 100% of the time, a real double (like a side by side) might suit you better.  But given that I already have a Vista and could use a double now and then, the rumble seat definitely works.  Now I need to decide if I want to splurge for a piggyback too...",4

"3805","Chicco Cortina KeyFit 30 Travel System in Adventure","My husband and I bought this travel system to use with our daughter who is due May 24th. We haven\'t had a chance to use it yet, but so far we like it a lot. My husband put it together in about 20 minutes, and while he (and I) got a bit confused about some things like how to lower the footrest and how to get the carseat in/out of the stroller/base, I think that is just because we are first-time parents and we\'ve never dealt with any of that. Once we figured out we had to press the orange button on the carseat, it was a cinch to move the carseat between the base and stroller. We like how it clicks into place and you can tell it\'s snug. My husband liked the velcro on the canopy of the carseat and the storage space in the base, and I like the ergonomic feel of the handlebar and how it can be raised and lowered to accommodate our different heights (I am 5\'5"" and he is about 6 feet). It would be nice to have an extra cupholder though, and the cupholder that is in the stroller does seem a bit on the shallow side, but this isn\'t a dealbreaker. The system seems very sturdy and is made of high-quality material. So far we\'re very pleased with our purchase and can\'t wait to be able to use it!",5
"3806","Safety 1st Space Saver Infant Tub, Blue","I bought this tub to take with us when we got to visit the grandparents. It does fold up compactly. However, it is definitely for a larger baby (6 months+). My daughter was 4 months when I tried to put her in the tub. The slope of the back was too reclined and she kept slipping. She hated it! She always loves her bath in her tub at home. The only difference that I can see is that our tub at home has a steeper back, so she is sitting up straighter. I think this tub would be gone for a baby that can sit and/or on the bigger size.",3

I have the red one and it looks so nice I often find people staring at it hahaI love that it is so light and closest up so small I can literally stuff it in a closet. The straps are very adjustable. I love all of the features specially love that my baby is able to look at me while we ride. Its also very comfortable for a couple like us that doesnt have a car, when we are out and about we can change diapers comfortably (we recline it flat then put baby opposite head to where the fit goes, tuck a plastic bag under in case of anything leaking and whola problem solved). When our baby falls asleep she sleep comfortably. I like that it has the two openings on the side since our little one can look out and explore the world yet sleep look at her mommy and daddy for comfort.CONWhen you close it, it is almost like carrying two strollers.It feels a little &#34;flimsy&#34; like a &#34;wobbles&#34;.It does not include a cup holder and it is an additional $25 to get one.It is a little uncomfortable for taller. My husband is 6&#34;1 and I am 5&#34;5 so we have to almost bend a little.Overall its a VERY longlasting stroller doesnt get very dirty and I would definitely recommend.",5
"3813","Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch","We added this video monitor sold through Soltech Security to our baby registry.  Upon receipt everything worked fine.There are a few minor quirks mentioned in other reviews.-The lack of an option to turn off the loud start-up sound-Battery life on Video Monitor is short ~4-6 hours (with intermittent checking of video)But video and audio quality were great at purchase.However after 3-4 months with this monitor the audio does not work.  Even at max volume you can barely hear the baby crying.We have tried restarting and pairing the monitor and camera again but it makes no difference.  The monitor speaker seems fine as the annoying start up sound is as loud as ever.  But the microphone doesn\'t seem to pick up any noise.Looking at other reviews this is not a rare issue.Until this issue is resolved either by Samsung or the seller, I would recommend not purchasing this product.",1

We also have an older model but we got this one because we now have twins and needed a second one (they both *LOVE* the swing).  The older model makes noise when it swings back and forth and we were hoping that this one would be more silent.  There were two things that a swing had to have for us 1) it had to swing side-to-side, not just front to back (they are particular) and 2) it had to have a mobile that moves.  This had both and was cheaper than what I was able to find at any of our local stores.",4

It is fine while she is using it, but when she is finished, pressure builds up in the straw an as soon as I go to grab it to clean up, the thing starts spewing liquid.  Sometimes it waits until its been in the fridge for awhile and I have a shelf full of milk.

The bucket is miraculously whole considering that it has also been used as step-stool, seat and pretend bath for dolls.The fact that the dinosaurs have their names printed on the belly (not easy to read) gives me the opportunity to tell them their real names, and learn for myself too!All in all, the most used toy in our home. I dare say one of them has played with the dinosaurs almost every day since we purchased them three years ago.

The high sides are an added safety feature as it discourages our son from reaching the edge of the regular tub and start climbing. The price is great, so much so that we bought one for each set of grandparents so that he can have his regular bathtub when we visit them.

Although she grasps the concept of drinking from a cup, she would never actually drink much from them. We have tried Playtex, Nuby, Munchkin and Avent among other brands. Finally someone passed along a Born Free Trainer Cup, and we\'ve finally found what we were looking for. As soon as I handed her this one, she was able to drink from it easily and starting draining everything we put in it.-We have the soft spout 6m+ training cup, and it does not leak at all. My daughter has vigorously put that to the test by batting it around her highchair tray, flipping it upside down in her lap, and flinging it onto the floor. We\'ve never had any issue with any leaks.-The handles make it very simple for her to pick up, hold, and tip the cup to be able to drink from it alone.-I like the measuring marks on the side to know how much liquid is in it, and easily determine how much she drank.-The cap fits on the top very well for transport.-Although it does have a number of pieces (cup, vent, handles, spout), I actually find it easier to put together than some of the other brands. I like that the spout is one whole piece, for me that\'s simpler than a brand like the Nuby where the spout had to be fit into the collar to be screwed on.Cons-It is more expensive than the other brands I tried. Average cost for the other cups was around $6-7, while this one is $10-11. I shouldn\'t be surprised my daughter has expensive taste. :-) However, they do sell just replacement spouts which are cheaper, so that can save the expense of having to replace the whole cup when the spouts are worn.-Additional pieces: although I do think the whole cup goes together quite easily, it\'s more to wash and keep track of. Having used Dr. Browns bottles for 10 months now, I\'m getting used to that!This is the one sippy cup that my daughter has been willing to drink from, so that makes it worthwhile for me unless there were major cons. Overall though, there is a lot to like about this cup. It seems to provide a pretty easy transition from bottle to cup. I am definitely going to be picking up more of them for my daughter.",5
"3850","Fisher-Price Jumperoo, Rainforest Friends","This is our second jumparoo and we love it!  We also have an exersaucer from the other brand and hands down our kids have enjoyed the jumparoo much more.  The fabric is easy to remove and clean.

Besides the size, the bag is well constructed and will work perfectly to store in the car for when I am out and not home.",4
"3853","Sippy Cup","I specifically bought this cup because it is free flowing - no gasket. I wanted my daughter to learn how to drink out of a cup, so that all she had to do was tip it up for liquid to come out. This was great until she decided that it was fun to pour water on her tray, the floor and herself. This would be great for an older child who is transitioning from a sippy to a cup. I like the simple design and materials.The only drawback is that it is really hard to get the cap off.",4
"3854","Bella Tunno Ribbon Loop Binker Pacifier Clip, Ocean Stripes/Blue Hawaiian Stripes","I purchased this clip for my daughter over a year ago and with the arrival of #2 I decided to purchase another one.  I purchased the same brand but not the same color.  I am sad to say I am very disappointed in the quality of this clip.  There are strings (which is really plastic thread - kinda like fishing line) all over it.  I started to cut them off when I noticed that sections of the fabric and label are not entirely sewn on.  I can fit my finger in between the 2 pieces of fabric in one area.  This is nothing I can\'t fix but disappointed in the quality and wanted to make others aware.",3
"3855","Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","&#34;Look, a zeeba!  It\'s a zeeba!&#34;  You can\'t do much better than that when your 4-year old sees you pulling her new zebra backpack out of the box.  So, she loves the design, and mommy and daddy love the solid construction (I\'ve even picked it up by the ears and yarn hairs when grabbing without looking, with no indication that it\'ll fall apart any time soon), the padded shoulder straps (not too narrow, not to wide, with anatomical curve), the oversized zipper pulls and smooth zipper action (just right for little hands), and the size (just right for little torsos).  Okay, you can\'t put papers in it without them getting wrinkled corners, as others have mentioned, but they\'re preschoolers.  Everything else gets wrinkled, stained, and torn, so why not the stupid notices about how to check your kid\'s scalp for lice?",5

"3858","Graco Highback TurboBooster Car Seat, Spitfire","We have an older model of this seat and it\'s been absolutely fantastic so we bought another.  Unfortunately the seatbelt guide built into the backrest has been redesigned and makes it tough to pull the seatbelt through it, and due to this the seatbelt sometimes comes out of the guide completely.  This is a safety issue and also an annoyance, so while the seat still works well otherwise I can no longer recommend it.  Can\'t believe Graco tested this new design out and found it to be acceptable.  Very disappointed.",2
"3859","Fleurville Kids Messenger, Black","My daughter was thrilled to get this backpack as a back-to-school gift in late summer and now half way through second grade, it\'s served her well so far.  It\'s very well made, attractive, and includes a lunch sack.  Bright and cute!  It is a little softer than a typical backpack, but that does not detract from usability.My daugher can easily wear it as a backpack or a messenger bag as it was intended.  At age 7, she\'s able to make the quick adjustments herself based on what she wants - to carry over one shoulder or over both.It easily holds a couple of folders, 2 workbooks, lunch (in the provided lunch sack), her mittens, a hat, water bottle, afternoon snack and two elementary-level library books easily.  Would not hold say two-three text books with these other items, but could hold just three large texts alone without the rest.  My daugher has also stuffed a sweatshirt or cardigan inside during those cooler/warmer days of fall pretty easily (non-mitten/hat-wearing season).Perfect for a kindergarten to fourth grade student!  If a kid needs to carry more than this by age 9, then it\'s too much as boys and girls this age should not carry more than 15% of their body weight, which is up to 10-11 pounds in most cases.Would highly recommend to friends and other kids for sure!!",NA

"3862","Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I think this is a really cute seat and works well.  The only problem is there is a white tray attached to the blue tray.  Then there is a green lid that covers the white tray.  My son is only 10 months old and he pulls the white tray off by himself, making it no longer useful to put food on because he can pull it off and drop it on the floor.  So we just use the blue tray to put the food on.  Wish they would have made the white tray attach more securely.  Still a great seat.",4

It introduces the concept without the hard plastic spout (which my son hates).It is spill-proof, unless your children start to chew on the spout.

Rest assured my precious little ones are no longer dragging a handful of books to stack on a step stool to reach light switches.  Guilty as charged:  I actually installed one switch for myself.  Moving into a new home with lots of randomly placed switches, I was sick of dragging my hand along the wall in the dark (in hopes of finding the light switch), so I installed one in a long hallway, just for mom!

"3877","Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch","I have been using a Motorola MBP36 for almost 1 year (purchased on December 2011), and it died on me last month. I have to say MBP36 is quite decent unit until it is broken. Motorola\'s customer service is absolutely horrible, and they will replace your broken unit with another broken unit. I finally give up with all the hassle and decided to look for another baby monitor. I came up across that Samsung recently released new baby monitors, so I tried SEW-3036, but without pan and tilt, it was no use to me.Between SEW-3036 and SEW-3037, the price different is $50 and that\'s the price for pan and tilt function with night light. The parent unit of SEW-3036 and SEW-3037 have very similar design, button layout, and function. In SEW-3037\'s product description, it advertised as 900 foot coverage when 3036 has 800 foot coverage. But to me, it was pretty much same.Let\'s compare between SEW-3037 and MBP36 here:Resolution: SEW-3037 &lt; MBP36With level 5 brightness setting, MBP36 looks more colorful than SEW-3037. SEW-3037 is clam and darker display. If you will constantly check the monitor, SEW-3037 will be better because MBP36 is too bright and color smudges when you stare it for long time.Interface: SEW-3037 > MBP36Button layout of 3037 is way much better than MBP36 because when you control the baby camera, MBP36 is giving you a hard time since navigation control is located in the left side as vertical line. I always confused with up and down (top two buttons) and right and left (bottom two buttons).  On the other hand, 3037\'s navigation control is round shape which is pretty common for controlling pan and tilt camera and easy to control. Clearly, for controlling the camera unit, 3037 is the winner.Night Vision: SEW-3037 > MBP36Because of calm and invisible IR display, 3037 looks better than MBP36 in the night time.Sound: SEW-3037 > MBP36The accuracy of sound level is identical between 3037 and MBP36, but 3037 has VOX feature which I really like. I do not know why MBP36 does not have VOX feature when it is pretty much standard for baby monitors. Moreover, accessing volume control in the night with MBP36 gives you pain since you have to go through the main menu to change the volume. On the contrary, 3037\'s volume control button is located on left side of parent unit which is convenient in the night. 3037 supports mute when MBP36 doesn\'t.Pan & Tilt Camera: SEW-3037 > MBP36Rotating speed and angle is identical. 3037 camera has more slick and professional looking. MBP36 has temperature sensor when 3037 doesn\'t. Yet, 3037 has night light which can be turned on or off from the parent unit.In my opinion, these two units are quite identical to each other and have crucial features of baby monitors, but yet, Samsung clearly did their homework to improve down flows of MBP36 by making SEW-3037 more user-friendly and get rid of unnecessary features such as temperature sensor. SEW-3037 is a well-built baby monitor that I highly recommend for anyone. If you are looking for updated version of MBP36, this is it.",5

He fell asleep in it last night and slept the whole night through in it!The plush cover is soft and very comfortable. It zips on and off to wash it. The bottom has a large velcro strap which you can undo to make the pillow looser and flatter at the bottom. When you strap it up it makes the pillow have more of a hollow in the center for snuggling down into for little ones. Also, what I couldn\'t tell in the picture is that the bottom center of the pillow has a white stretchy material so the kids are not on the carpet or hardwood floor.

What\'s worse is that because it is stretchy material, it stretches the longer you wear it.  I do not trust it to support my baby -- and there is definitely no head support for little ones when inward facing.  The sling causes other issues.  Once it\'s tight enough to hold baby somewhere *above* your waist, there\'s no room for baby to be comfortable.This item freed up one hand -- at best.

"3905","Edushape Magic Creations Bath Playset - Under the Sea","With a 3yr old son and 5 yr old daughter, we have purchased a LOT of bathtub toys. My kids play with this set, as well as the dinosaur set from Edushape for hours (or at least until all the hot water is gone). The toys in any of the sets (the one I\'m reviewing first has cars, bus, rescue vehicles, street and street signs) allow them to use their imagination to enact movement and sounds of the vehicles. It\'s fun to watch them dream up new scenarios.What I love about these toys compared to others that I\'ve had is how quickly they dry. We\'ve all had bath toys that squirt get moldy and gross inside. Others tend to get slimy. Not these. They dry quickly and are easy to wipe clean.One reviewer mentioned that they were of lower quality than the Alex brand and I have not found that to be true at all. We\'ve had these for about 2 months and there is no fading, chipping off of colors or any other quality issues. The pieces are thick and sturdy and are holding up well to nightly abuse. The colors are still bright and look great. They make a great gift, too. :)Update 12/11: Have had three of these sets for nearly a year and every piece is holding up as new. Kids are now 4 and 6 and still pllay with them during every bath. How many toys can you say that about a year later? :)",5

"3910","Fisher-Price Coco Sorbet Soothing Motions Glider","We really wanted to LOVE this glider, but ended up only liking it. Why? It eats batteries like they\'re going out of style. And at 4 D batteries a pop, it gets expensive.That said, the baby did like it...especially when he was tiny and wouldn\'t yet nap in his crib or pack-and-play. This glider would put him to sleep almost instantly. But even at only 8 or 9 pounds, it sounded like the motor was straining...and the fast speed was a joke.A new set of batteries lasted a day for us, at which point the thing would move if you bumped it, or it would move even slower than the hare setting, then start and stop in fits and spurts. New batteries would jazz it up again for awhile...but not nearly long enough.This would get a definite 4 stars if it was simply able to be plugged in and/or 5 stars if they added a vibration mode and a true fast speed.If you\'re going to try this, I recommend Craiglist. We spent about $50 on it and got most of our money back out of it when we resold it.",3

"3913","Regalo Extra Wide 58 Inch WideSpan Walk Through Safety Gate, White","Needed a gate to keep our 3 rescue dogs from rushing the front door when visitors come.  Works great.  If you have a wide area to block off you will need another person to help you set it up as the pieces come apart too easily.  Once installed, it was wonderful and worked great for the purpose we purchased it.  Much better than the wooden gate we were using that we had to step over all the time to enter the room - having the swing gate opening is a life saver!!!!  Personally I would like a slightly larger width to the swing gate area but I\'ve gotten use to angling my body as I pass through.",5
"3914","Go-Go Babyz Sidekick Bliss Diaper Bag, Yellow","With four kids to keep track of on very little sleep, I\'m grateful to anyone who reduces the number of baby gear items I need to lug. I gave the bag a thorough test during a weekend trip to San Francisco with the whole family.Judged simply as a diaper bag, the Sidekick gets high marks. It is roomy without being bulky. Has two convenient side pockets to hold bottles and plenty of compartments inside to organize diapers, wipes, a few toys and a change of clothes: all I needed for a four hour flight in one bag. The bag came with a matching changing pad and an insulated pouch for breast milk or formula. Fully loaded for the flight, I liked that the pouch was easily clipped to the outside of my filled to the gills diaper bag.Now what about looks? Baby gear has definitely gotten a lot more stylish in the last five years and this bag is no exception. It comes in a rainbow of fun colors. Mine is hot pink with trendy gray accents and I get a lot of compliments on it, before I\'ve even mentioned the awesome baby carrier feature.The baby carrier is tucked into the front flap of the bag. I found it easy to set up on the go; certainly easier than trying to tie a Moby Wrap around me, and maybe even a little easier than strapping a Baby Bjorn without tangling the straps. You unzip the top of the flap, turn the flap inside out to reveal a softer fabric, snap on the belt strap, and lengthen the shoulder strap to fit around your neck. All of this can be done quickly before deplaning, giving you a free hand to maneuver.",5

"3918","Scootababy Baby Carrier, Taupe","One of the best baby carriers out there. It does not put any pressure on the back, the baby is not dangling in front of you like a lead weight, and it lets you use your hands freely.

"3919","Chicco Liteway Plus Stroller, Equinox","I just bought this stroller a couple days ago from Baby\'s R Us. We took it to the mall to try it out, and I absolutely love it! I already have a Chicco Keyfit 30 carseat, and I wanted a lightweight stroller that would fold down compactly and could carry my infant seat along with a big enough basket to carry all my stuff in. the carseat ""clicks"" into the stroller, so you know its secure. We looked at a few different models before we ultimately decided on this one. Most of the lightweight strollers seemed too flimsy, and it was hard to find one that I could put an infant carrier in. And if they had any sort of basket at all, the frame of the stroller blocked access to it. This stroller has a decent size basket that is easy to get to, and is easy to convert from a stroller seat to an infant carrier, all you have to do is flip the seat forward.It seems to be adequately padded and also has removable shoulder padding on the harness. It reclines almost completely flat, which I also like.The only con I can think of is that the front wheels don\'t glide left to right quite as smoothly as my last stroller. But I imagine a little wd-40 would fix that problem.Overall I am very happy with this stroller. It has just what I need, a compact ""umbrella"" type fold, it\'s lightweight, and it carries my infant carrier.",5
"3920","Contours Lite Stroller, Tangerine","We love this stroller.  My daughter will be 3 and we still use it.  It is so much better than an umbrella stroller, but not nearly as bulky as a regular stroller.  It has a huge storage area under the seat, 2 cup holders.  It is very easy to get the child in and out of.  It maneuvers very easily across any terrain except sand.  It is lightweight and has great color choices!  Highly recommend!!",5
"3921","Thinkbaby Complete BPA Free Feeding Set, Orange, 6 Months","I bought this set when it was still pretty new on the market and was excited about it at first. But before I had been using it too long, the ""Thinkbaby"" logo started wearing off the product and it really makes it look junky. Now I\'ve had the product for about a year and the lids no longer stay tight on the round bowls (although I do not put them in the dishwasher, so it\'s not heat that warped them). The rectangular bento box still works well. But long-term, I have been much happier with my Kids Konserve containers. Whatever part of my purchase price went towards the silverware was totally wasted. This silverware is functionally almost useless. The fork will never pick up anything for sure, and the spoon doesn\'t hold much at all. I would rather my children eat off of metal than plastic anyway, which is why I got this set to begin with.The plastic outer pieces are difficult to get off of the stainless steel pieces for washing, especially the cup.I also have a weird rust-like stain on the steel part of the cup, as someone else mentioned in another review.Many months ago I emailed the company because I was briefly looking for a replacement lid, and wanted to share my disappointment about the flaking/scratching logo and the silverware. Never heard a word back from them.",2
"3922","The First Years Babypro All In One Baby Food Maker","I didn\'t actually buy this on Amazon (so I did pay too much) but I just wanted to let people know that I think this is an excellent purchase.  I really like that the steam and chop chambers are separate, I actually have found that when I am making the food I can even have two different types of food going at once (one it the steamer and one in the chopper) or can also clean the chopper while the steamer is still going, which would seem to not be an option with the Beaba.  I\'ve been really happy with the purchase and don\'t think that the $150 price range of the Beaba one is necessary.",4
"3923","Tadpoles Triple Layer Tulle Crib Skirt in White","I wanted something pink and girly but not overwhelming for my baby crib.  This piece is it.

"3924","Lansinoh Diaper Rash Ointment 3 oz (85 g)","I found out about this product last summer when my 18 month old had diarrhea on and off for over three months. When none of the other major brands worked, I resorted to anti-fungal creams; however, those did not work, so I kept searching. The Lansinoh cream was the only thing I could find that would help heal severe diaper rash. I don\'t use it as an everyday barrier (due to the price), but I keep it around in case my babies start to develop a rash. Definitely worth the price, but hard to find in stores...I order it on Amazon (wish they\'d make it Prime eligible).",5
"3925","Carter\'s Easy Fit Printed Crib Fitted Sheet, Animal","I bought the Carter\'s Easy Fit Printed Crib Fitted Sheet in Sage Stripe. The color is very nice (I wouldn\'t say vibrant but powdery) and the pattern goes very Very well with my GEENNY Boy Artist Bedding Set. It fits my Sealy Baby Firm Rest Crib Mattress, a standard 51.6 x 27.2 x 5.8 inches which fits like a glove which is GREAT.I\'ve read other reviews and can agree on the texture. Its cotton, so, its absorbancy and durability are good. It IS a 200-thread count which isn\'t very soft but not rough like flannel. I\'ve washed the fitted sheet twice, and air dried it both times, as I do not have a drier, having absolutely no shrinkage. I can\'t confirm the shrinkage in a drier but I can say air drying the sheet doesn\'t do it harm.Personally, I like Boa fitted sheets but babies are messy and cotton sheets are cheaper and plentiful.",NA
"3926","VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor","These are great monitors.  This is my third set between these and the double parent unit.  I leave mine on 24/7. I have the double set up with the base in the nursery, a parent unit in the bedroom and one in the living room.  I have the single base next to the one in the living room with the parent unit in the basement so I can piggyback off the nursery unit.  Of all the monitors I have used, these seem to have the best reception.  Mine are seldom on battery power, but when I do unplug a parent unit, it works for what I need it to.  The only background noise I hear with these is the air vents on occasion.  My old ones would pick up a train 2 miles away.  I\'m partially deaf, but I can still hear when my son rolls over, even in the basement with my piggyback contraption set up.Without fail, within about 6 months they lose connection and there is nothing you can do about it.  Amazon has been great about returns so far.  They pay the return shipping and send me new ones before they even get the return.  I wonder if Vtech will ever fix the problem.",NA
"3927","Eddie Bauer Adventurer Travel System, Stonewood","We\'ve been using this travel system only for a month, and it\'s working fine so far.Our son has two months now. Since he struggled with some reflux from the beginning, the doctor recommended to keep him in an upright position for at least one hour after each feeding. We started using the travel system with the car seat attached, to keep him upright and it worked. Then we tried to sleep our baby in there, since he wasn\'t sleeping properly in his crib, and it was great. So he has been sleeping in the travel system for a month now. And we have taken a couple of strolls in the park, and he loves it.The only cons I see about the product are the following:- The handle on the car seat makes a loud noise when it locks in a position, and it startles the baby.- It\'s a little bit tricky and difficult to lock and unlock the car seat to it\'s base.- The seat belts are a bit difficult to put on.Everything else is great.",4
"3928","Noodlehead Travel Buddies Neck Pillow - Dog","I ordered the puppy neck pillow which is beige and brown but I got sent the blue puppy instead.

This may be better for older toddlers. I\'ll have to just set this aside for another year or so.",3
"3929","Cardinal Gates Versagate, White","These gates are awesome.  We bought two to section off a few large openings in our house.One goes across a big opening between the Living and Great Rooms.  The opening was about 6 inches less than the total span of what the gate would handle.  The options were to either have the gate angle out into or out off one of the rooms, or mount it to the face of the wall and let the gate run past the opening so it site flush with the wall.  We went with option two and love how this gate functions.The second location was across our Kitchen.  We have one end that needed to mount to the cabinets.  Not a fan of driving screws in finished cabinets so we took the gate hardware and secured it to the cabinets with some 3M Command tape strips.  The gate hasn\'t budged and when it comes time for the gate to down, pull the strips and remove the tape.  Gotta love that stuff.Buying these two gates make the fourth and fifth Cardinal gates that we have bought.  All of them are functioning exactly the same day as they did when they were new.  I\'ve had wood and plastic gates and they work for about a year before they start breaking and failing.  I wouldn\'t buy anything but Cardinal.BTW, all our gates are for cording off our dogs, not kids, so the review is based on that type of use not with children.  But I have to think there wouldn\'t be any difference in the performance of the gates.",5
"3930","Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We bought this swing 2 weeks ago, and my 7 week old loves it!  However the other reviewers are right on, there is only ONE SPEED!  Which makes no sense, there are six slots to turn to and the speed stays the same, which worries me when she grows.  I am hoping the motor holds.I can\'t find 16 songs for the life of me, I have found 8 and lots of nature noises.  Plugging it in is the way to go, I don\'t have to worry about getting up to restart the music so that makes it worth the price.  We got a great deal on sale at Amazon, which I love by the way, for $116.00  Other swings are about the same with tax so I would recommend it.",NA

Another issue is the straw doesnt reach the bottom of the cup leaving about an ounce or two of liquid that cant be reached, what a waste!",2

"3943","Fisher-Price Musical Mobile, Rainforest Peek-a-Boo Leaves","This baby mobile is perhaps the best thing I have ever invested in. As a freshmen at Princeton, I was pretty nervous about starting college. However, I knew one of the ways I could bring my childhood and home with me was by decorating my room with a piece that evokes not only the playful and carefree nature of childhood, but also serves as a deep and penetrating metaphor for the ironic and misogynistic philosophies of many modern house cats. Ever since I was a youngin, I have been tortured by the heartless attitude that house cats have toward me. I felt that I would be lost if I didn\'t continue to harbor my hatred of these creatures while exploring my collegiate interests and broadening my world view. Hanging this mobile in my dorm room has helped me to become an active global citizen, in my opinion. I have garnered the respect of many of my professors as well as the other students on my floor. I highly suggest that an parent endeavoring to educate and enlighten their child, regardless of age, buy this mobile and hang it directly about their pillow. It is the will of the forest nymphs that all children become enlightened. That is why I have this mobile, and why my parents were willing to pay many dollars to give me a gift that I love. I encourage you to do the same for your own child! You will not regret giving them this one of a kind opportunity.",5

We used them this Fourth of July for Firework viewing, and instead of being startled by the loud booms, the little one was completely mesmerized to the point of forgetting to suck on the pacifier.

"3950","Tiny Love ActiviTot - Tropic Isle","To be honest, I think the activity mat is very expensive; however I think it is the best one on the market.  When my daughter was younger (She is now 2), I had purchased a mat but it doesn\'t even compare to this one.  My son is already enjoying it (He is a 7 weeks old).Reasons why I like it:1.The mat size is large compared to other mats on the market.  I feel that it will grow with my baby more so than the typical sqaure mats.2. Also I really like how I can reconfigure the mat in several different ways to better suit my baby\'s needs.  The only drawback is when the loops are stretched criss cross across the widest part of the mat, it leaves little room for the baby to be underneath the cross section (since the toys hang down from it).  My only wish was that the loops were a little larger.3.  It includes a lot of built-in toys and features which eliminates the need to purchase additional toys to add to it.(However after reading several of the positive customer review, I did purchase the wind chimes.  My son and daughter love playing with them!) I also like the fact that some toys can be attached to the base of the mat as well as above on the loops.4.  It folds up into a compact carrying case, which makes it easy to travel with!5.  The mat is padded (for extra comfort) and contains a firm rim around the edge.  These features prevent the mat from being scrunched up when the baby is active.6.  Lastly, I love the baby pillow that comes with it!  It is great for positioning the baby on his back or tummy!This is a great mat!  I am so glad that I purchased it!",5

"3955","ChooMee Sip\'n Soft Top - Red and Purple","These work fairly well, but like many other tips for food pouches they are not perfect.  I also ownPouchPop Topper 2 Pack for Pouch Feeding, 4 Months Plus - Red/Orange, so I will try to make a comparison of the two.Functionality: The benefit to the ChooMee tops is the little valve that prevents accidentally-on-purpose spills when baby squeezes the pouch.  The top is all one piece of silicone and the valve itself is a thin piece of silicone with a slit down the middle. PouchPop tops have no valve and baby can just squeeze the food out everywhere.  Well, both have their pro\'s and cons as far as the functionality.  The ChooMee tops are awesome at preventing accidental spills, but they are also really difficult to suck the food out of unless the puree is very thin (I mean watered down regular yogurt with no fruit thin).  So most of the time we end up using the PouchPop tops because even thick purees will come out of this just fine.  Because there is no valve, these allow a lot of food to flow out at one time, so young babies might have a hard time with that.Caps: The little cap on the ChooMee feeder is a nice touch.  These are great if baby doesn\'t eat all of the pouch at once and you don\'t want to take this off to replace the cap temporarily.  PouchPops do not have these.  Although this isn\'t a huge issue for us, my baby does sometimes get distracted by the cap hanging off of the ChooMee top and would rather play with it than eat.Staying put on Pouch: ChooMee tops push onto the food pouch and kind of ""snap"" on.  They are super easy to put on and even more easy to take off.  This has been our biggest issue with these caps.  My 12 month old is constantly taking off the cap, then the contents of the pouch spill everywhere.  The PouchPop tops screw on to the cap and have fit every pouch I\'ve tried (squooshie refillable, infantino pouches, and store bought pouches).  These definitely win in this category because my baby cannot get the off of the pouches. Update: I recently bought theSquooshi Reusable Food Pouch | 8 Pack - G.O. Pattern | Refillable Squeeze Pouches for Kids of All Agesand the ChooMee tops are perfect for these!  It is harder to snap them on, but my baby can\'t get them off.  I still use PouchPop toppers more often because I tend to make thick purees that flow more easily through the PouchPop.Overall: Both are made of quality silicone material, they are super easy to clean, and work decently for their purpose.  Neither is perfect.  The ChooMee caps are probably better for younger infants (6 months and up), and the PouchPop tops are probably better for older babies (12 months and up) when the baby is better about not squeezing the pouch too hard and they can handle more food at one time.",4
"3956","Cloud b Sleep Sheep On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds","When we bought Sleep Sheep on the Go for our granddaughter, my husband bought an extra Sleep Sheep -- for me.  I\'ve had insomnia for a few years now, and have been reluctant to rely on prescription sleep aids; so when I saw this cute little stuffed animal, I hinted that I might like one, too, and I got it.I have to say, this thing is incredible.  At night, I slip it onto my bedpost by the on-the-go strap and set it for my favorite soothing sound -- rain -- and within a minute or two, I\'m out cold.  When I wake up in the middle of the night, I just hit the ""Rain"" button, roll over, and am fast asleep in no time.  I\'ve actually been sleeping my full 8 hours!The only reason I didn\'t give this five stars is that you have to unscrew the sound device to change the batteries.  Yes, I realize this is primarily for children, and it\'s important that they can\'t get the battery-storage box open, but I do wish there were an easier way to make it just as secure.

"3957","InfinityMOM Nursing Scarf (Coral Chevron)","The style of the cover is quite cute, and looks great as a scarf (5* on that) but for me, as a nursing cover, it was not so good. I am a petite person with a smaller chest and this just kept falling open all the time. It takes me one hand to hold the baby and one to hold the nursing cover up on the side that is not hanging off my shoulder. I could drape it around both shoulders, but then the cover would be over my baby\'s face (which she hates) and I could not check her as she fed (she unlatches a lot - even more when she can\'t see me). I actually prefer the apron ones that have some support around the neck so that I can look down and see my daughter. Also with the way it hangs on me, she can pull it off in one good tug. It is good that I can use it after she is done nursing, but I don\'t think I will use it much to cover up.",3
"3958","Dream On Me Scout Musical Walker and Activity Center, Pink","It\'s cute and sturdy however the music Blares so loud and can\'t be turned down- we had to put tape over the speaker to help. Also the music only worked correctly for about a week and stopped- apparently your babies can\'t slobber at all when they are in this or it shorts out and it will play until the batteries run out.",2

"3961","Britax Marathon 70 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","We have the older version of this car seat and bought this one for our new arrival. Cover is very easy to remove and wash and replace. I just stick it in the washer on cold gentle cycle with baby friendly soap and hang it to dry over night and put it back together in the morning and its ready to go again like new. Easy to adjust as the kiddies grow; no more removing straps or reinserting buckles and stuff. The back has an easy adjust handle that lets you slide the straps up and down with one hand! Worth the money for the easy and range of growth it has on it. 5lbs.(newborn)- 70lb(school age).",5

She has loved it right from the beginning and now at 10 months she still has fun with it in the car.  It is great for teething and the mirror on the back catches her interest.  Now that she is older she likes to point out the facial features on the front.  I\'m very glad I got this toy.",5
"3965","Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary)","Our son has a bad habit of wanting to cuddle with a cup in bed. Once he was weaned off the bottle, we had to find a cup that we could put water into so that he could drink out of it at night with no dental worries, but that didn\'t leave his clothes and bedding all wet. The Playtex cups have really been a hit. I would say that they aren\'t as completely shake-proof as the Gerber Graduates, but they are definitely tip-proof and don\'t leak even rolling around a bed all night. I would say 99.98%. Plus, my little man seems to like these a lot more than the rest. They are a nice slim, easy to hold design, with nice kinda sparkly colors. You can replace the valves if they get old. They are easy to clean. We use the  Gerber Graduates for play time cups (no problem leaking when bounced, dropped, etc.) and the Playtex Sipsters for night time, bed time, dinner time, etc. We\'ve tossed out or donated everything else.",5

"3970","Playtex Nurser With Drop-Ins Liner, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary, 3-Count","I originally purchased this system 9 years ago (before the nicer designer style came out)for my oldest daughter and I liked them so much.... that when my second child was born I used them again... I couldn\'t help it... I loved the fact that you could literally push all of the air out of the bottle... so I knew she wasn\'t consuming a ton of air and I liked the fact that she didn\'t have to lie flat in order to eat... which of course prevented liquid from draining down into her inner ears.  As a result... my daughter\'s neither one ever suffered from ear infections or colic.  I mean you\'ve got to love that.  Thinking of course that my second child was more than likely my last... I got rid of these bottles when I got rid of most of our other ""baby"" stuff.  Now that I am pregnant with our third child... what else would I buy.  These bottles are great and I highly recommend them.  My sisters used this system for their children and each had the same colic free, ear infection free results that I had.  Personally I think that says it all.",5
"3971","Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer","I registered for this wipes warmer even though I wasn\'t sure how much we needed it.  Soon after our son was born, we started using it and we were very pleased.  Even as a newborn, our son cried much less during diaper changes when the wipes were warmed. I felt especially good about using it during the winter when diaper changes must be pretty chilly for baby!  The wipes stayed moist as long as you keep a little water in the warmer, per the instructions, and the wipes were warm, not hot.  I stopped using the warmer in the spring, but I plan on getting it out again now that cold weather is back.  While it may seem unneccesary at first, I\'m sure most of us wouldn\'t feel that way if we were the ones being changed several times a day!  All in all, a great purchase and/or gift.",5

I thought it was great quality in comparison to the red gate check bag you may see on here ( i got this for our car seat ).  This black bag was much more durable.  Though for what it was intended - the red bag worked just fine too - it protected the car seat from getting torn or dirty and thats all that mattered to me.",5
"3976","Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red","My 2 year old son loves using this potty. Does both businesses without issue. Big enough so he can hold down his , well, you know. Fits easily into purse or diaper bag, and is great for any public situation. I hate public bathrooms, so I just set it up in the back of the SUV and have him go. We have no issues with the legs. You have to hear the click to make sure they are in correctly. The legs convert to handles when you at at grandma\'s or playdates where you can trust the potty to be clean to touch. Potty cleans up quick and easy too. We have even used it on an airplane. You know how small and nasty those things are. We use BIOBags 3gallon bags instead of the refills for this potty. BioBags meet California enviornmetal standards and completly biodegrades in under 45 days. Made of corn and not petro based. You can even flush them.",5
"3977","Munchkin Arm &amp; HammerDiaper Bag Refills, 72-Count","The first &#34;batch&#34; of bags I purchased at wal-mart and kept in the diaper bag. I used them for every messy diaper while we were out in public, traveling by pane, or visiting friends\' and relatives\' houses. I like that the bags are lightly scented and the color is nice and doesn\'t scream &#34;bag with a poopy diaper&#34;. I actually misplaced the plastic dispenser long ago, but I just put a mini elastic rubber band to keep the roll from unraveling and toss it in the diaper bag.I\'m sure there are other brands of this type of product, but I\'ve found something I like and I\'m sticking with it. I actually live overseas and had this, along with other familiar, comfort products shipped out to me. It\'s the third time I\'ve bought these refills which shows that they were/are an asset for my diaper bag. There were times when I haven\'t been able to toss a diaper right away, so these came in handy when I changed a diaper and had to &#34;hold&#34; it until I could find a receptacle. They are also appreciated by flight attendants when you contain a stinky diaper before you throw it away in the lavatory.  I\'ve even used them to contain clothes that have been soiled or ruined before putting them in the basket of my stroller or in a suitcase to take home before laundering.I don\'t have any cons. The rolls seem to last for a long time, the bags are a nice long size should you want to contain several diapers. Overall, I will continue to purchase these for as long as I see a need to contain wet or dirty messes while on the go.",5
"3978","Glass Table and Shelf Corner Cushions","I was unpleasantly surprised to find this product made of PVC. Shame on them for using a dangerous material on a product within reach of babies. It emits the characteristic nasty, greasy smell of the stuff. I\'ve already sent mine back.",1
"3979","UPPAbaby Stroller Parent Organizer, Black","This stroller caddy is okay.  It fits well on the Uppa stroller and has convenient pockets for car keys and some money.  My only complaint is that the drink holder is flimsy.  I feel confident with a water bottle in the holder, but I would never place a cup of coffee or tea in the holder.  Due to the placement of the caddy, you have to remove it every time you unfold the stroller if you are using the infant insert and need to put the seat back for your little one.",NA
"3980","Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle","My 5-month-old daughter loves this jumper.  She will happily play in it for an hour or two.  The jumper is easy to assemble and place on the doorjamb, although this process definitely requires two hands (something of a luxury with a 5-month-old!).  The jumper is very height-adjustable; once you think you\'ve reached the end, you CAN adjust it further!  If you (like me) accidentally threw out the instructions with the box, you can view them online[...].  The only complaint i have about this product is that it\'s quite difficult to maneuver the baby into and out of the seat, since the strap design makes you wiggle them through a series of convoluted strapping.  Also, if you\'re tall or have back problems, this process will really not work for you.  For our needs, though, it\'s been great!",NA
"3981","Graco Pack \'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Bancroft","I LOVE this playpen.  My son slept in the bassinet in the livingroom for WEEKS and it saved his father and I from running up and down stairs all night long.  Especially handy since I had a c-section and simply couldn\'t do stairs.  It\'s padded and lined and comfortable as can be for a little one.  Since then, we\'ve taken the bassinet attachment off and are using the playpen part every day.  Small messes wipe clean with a wet towel - and big messes wash off with simply soap and water. My baby\'s learning to stand up in it and it keeps him from bumping and falling on hard surfaces.  He\'s never once tipped this thing over - from the inside or outside.  It\'s super simple to put together and even quicker to take down.  Even my own mom with arthritis can do it with no trouble.  It takes up less space than it looks, but offers plenty of room for a little one to play and sleep.  And - when it\'s all taken down and folded up, it just slides right under the baby\'s crib until you need it again.  We used to put baby changing stuff in the side compartment (which you can either use or just take off and store) but now we\'ve got board books and pacifiers and baby\'s favorite bedtime friends in it!  So handy to have these things right there at naptime!  Thanks Graco!(I also bought the matching car seat and stroller and love THOSE as well!)",5
"3982","Badger Basket 3 Pack Polka Dot Nesting Trapezoid Shape Folding Baskets, Pink","I bought this basket set to use in my daughter\'s nursery and absolutely LOVE them!

These baskets are timeless and will be able to grow with her due to their modern look!",5

Her head would always move around and I always had to have a hand on her head so the carrier really didn\'t help much for my hands to be free. The Baby Bjorn is wonderful! I used it with my friend\'s baby girl when she was a month old and what a difference!! She was snug and her head was positioned fine and I never worried about it moving around too much. The BEST thing is its easy to put on by yourself! No need for an extra set of hands to help adjust or put on. When I have another child I am definitely registering for this one!!",5

The only problem we have is our grandson likes to turn it upside down when the lid is open and then it leaks. No leaks though when the lid is down. This makes transporting in the diaper bag easy. We made our purchase after watching ""Shark Tank"" via Amazon. Love the fact it is American made. Might be on the pricier side but love the features and color variety.",4
"3986","Fisher-Price Adorable Animals Baby\'s Bouncer","This chair was very cute and my baby liked it.  She only used it for a few months before she got bored of being strapped to one place.

As a parent, it is important to me to have my daughter happy, secure, and close to me.  She hates slings and the like, so I was baffled about what to do because I couldn\'t hold her all day.  I can easily bring this with me to different rooms of the house, and she loves it.  When she is fussy because of gas, and my arms are falling off from bouncing her, I put her in her chair on the floor, sit on the couch, and gently bounce her with my foot.  She immediately calms down.  I know it sounds over the top, but this chair makes me a better parent.  It is my miracle worker.",5

I bought it. From day one I loved it I threw out the genie and I won\'t go back.It only got 4 stars because you do need to buy fresh disks every so often. They are nice because when you open the pail you smell a fresh clean sent. Also I feel the pail could be taller, when I change the kitchen bag (which is the only time you really smell the foul diapers) my bag was only about 3/4 the way full.But other than that its a great investment, no smelly nursery and no dang refills to buy!",4

You put water in it and turn the timer 2.  It does not steam the milk so it preserves the nutrients (i pump exclusively so I really want to get the most benefits out of feeding my baby breast milk) 3. It holds frozen breastmilk bags! This has definitely come in handy lately as I\'m going through my supply and freezing what I pump every day. 4. It\'s a really nice, compact, well designed gadget",5

I thought by buying the Maclaren accessory I would get the best quality item, but this really falls short. I bought this specifically to have a place to hold drinks, and the only thing that would fit in these holders were the very slimmest water bottles. I suppose you could place a traditional baby bottle into these compartments, but my child uses a wide bottle and it just wouldnt fit. Even a slim single serve disposable water bottle had to be squeezed and pushed into the holder and trying to pull it back out would be a two handed job, certainly nothing you could do easily while strolling.",1

"4018","Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo","I bought this Jumperoo 3 years ago for my now 3 year old daughter and I just purchased a second one for my new baby (since I was dumb enough to give the first one away when my daughter outgrew it). Though after a year of use with the first one, this is what I found:- Durable! After a year of constant play and the rough housing of an older sibling on it, all we broke was the rainbow part (which still held on but was a bit loose).- Very entertaining. My daughter would scream every time I took her from the toy because she loved being in it so much.- Easy to clean. Once you get the hang of unsnapping the seat (which you can toss in the wash) it\'s real easy to clean.- Not terrible to transport. I wish it would hold together better while in it\'s collapsed state, but considering the size of this toy, it wasn\'t terrible to take with and it fit pretty easily into my car. We took it to every family holiday and babysitter.- Sturdy base. Even with an older child pushing on it, it never once tipped or seemed unsafe.- Worth the money. My daughter played in this at least once a day for over a year. She loved it and I had a safe place for my child to play while I tossed in some laundry or grabbed a quick shower.Can\'t wait for our new one to arrive. I hope my new baby loves this even half as much as my daughter did.",5

"4024","Skip Hop Moby Bath Kneeler, Blue","Nice and cushy! We have a teeny bathroom (maybe 5x6\') and don\'t have the space for a big kneeler or to store one. It does not skid, so the kiddos even step on it when they get out. (With those drips and the tidal wave of splashing going on in our bathroom, it gets very wet!!)  I hang it up to dry on the towel bar, and I haven\'t had any trouble with mildew. The label reads ""Spot clean only. Do not machine wash or dry,"" so after a year and a half, it is a little dingy/darkened in places. The velcro is maybe also a little worn, but the mat itself is in great shape---no rips or loose seams, and it is just as cushy as when we bought it. Really a nice mat for a small space, and we\'ve gotten a lot of use out of it.",4

When it finally came time to purchase it, I re-read the reviews on amazon and almost didn\'t buy it because of all the complaints about how big it was.  When it came and I installed it in my car (a Honda Fit), it fit no differently than the SnugRide.  I didn\'t have to adjust the seat in front at all.  Granted, the seat was already pushed up far to accommodate the SnugRide, but still - for being such a BIG car seat, it wasn\'t a problem in my little car.Setting it up was easy for the most part, although I found the shoulder harnesses a little difficult to get into the right slot.  And the padding isn\'t quite as cushy as I had imagined.  If we took a long car seat, I could see it becoming uncomfortable.  But overall, it\'s a nice car seat at a great price.",4

We have extremely hard water and a water softener that only likes to work when it feels like it.My cloth diapers had built up some crazy ammonia stench and overall funk that had my husband and I always trying to get the other to change the diaper.  I tried soaking for 1 hour, 3 hours, 5 hours...nothing happened.I decided to try some vinegar and oxygen booster to see if that would help.  It seemed to, so to make sure it was the vinegar and oxygen booster and not the Rockin\' Green, I used my original detergent (plain powdered Tide).  Sure enough, it was the same as when I used Rockin\' Green.  I\'ve heard from plenty of people that it\'s more about what works for you and I definitely feel that\'s the case.  For us, it happens to be vinegar, oxygen booster and lots of rinses.",NA

She weighs 11 pounds and is 3 months old.  I feel like it is too tight in the crotch area (and she\'s really small) and is possibly cutting off circulation around the thighs (or at least it feels that way).  I ordered the large but feel like it is small and I think the next size up would be too big.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

"4041","Onya Baby Cruiser Baby Carrier, Leaf Green/Umber","I heard so many great things about this carrier but it just wasn\'t what I was looking for. It\'s definitely great for a bigger baby. My daughter is 9 months and at least 30 pounds now and she was comfy. The panel is nice and high and the carrier looks great. I think it did great for a back carry but I still do mostly front carries because my daughter isn\'t always happy about being on my back. The front carry is what I couldn\'t get used to. I currently use an ergo but am trying to find something to replace it because my daughter is quickly outgrowing it. You can put this on just like an ergo but it didn\'t feel as good as the ergo does. I felt like I was constantly trying to adjust the straps to make it more comfortable. Also the shoulder straps tighten going the opposite direction than the ergo so you have to pull up and backward to tighten them and I just couldn\'t get used to it, I had to keep asking for help. I loved the idea of the cross strap feature and that was more comfortable than just using the chest clip but I found that difficult to do by myself too, mostly because my daughter is so busy. If she was a little younger and less active I think it would\'ve been easier to cross the straps and buckle them myself but she tends to move around a lot when I\'m putting her in a carrier. The pockets are great and I love the rings to hook toys too. And I did like it for a back carry (mostly because I didn\'t need anyone\'s help to adjust anything) but I just couldn\'t get used to the way everything adjusts for a front carry. Maybe I\'m just slow? LOL or just way too used to my ergo. I returned it and will keep searching. Happy baby wearing everyone!",3

The directions are clear and easy to follow. My favoriate feature is that this will be the only seat I will need for my kids!  It serves as a rear facing seat, a front facing seat, as well as a booster.  I love the weight limit range and the hight limit it goes to.  Plus it lasts for 10 years.  10 YEARS!!!  No need to replace after only 4-5 years due to short expiration dates.  I kept checking on all the various colors until I saw one of them go on sale and bought them then. The big buckle on the front is great, easy to click on and release with one hand but it is also hard for little fingers to unhook (which I like because it prevents my toddler from climbing out).

"4085","Inglesina 2012 Trip Stroller, Ibisco","I purchased this stroller based on the information on the web and customer reviews.  I have had 6 strollers with one child (graco travel system, graco snug ride, babiesrus umbrella stroller, valco baby ion, peg perego si, and maclaren techno XT).  3 1/2 years later i am still looking for that perfect lightweight stroller:)  Maclaren techno xt (at 16.8 LB) is still just too heavy for me.This stroller weighs 15.3 LB on my scale.  It is very nice looking, with durable and padded fabric.  It seems to have many desirable features:  stylish, large canopy with extension,  peekaboo window, bumper bar, rain cover. cup holder, and adjustable leg rest.  However, there are 2 design flaws for me:1)the large square canopy is just very bulky-- it makes me feel distant to my toddler (for conversation/interaction) during strolling.  And believe me i am all about large canopy.  The canopy on the inglesina swift is just as large but perfect(without the squareness and still has the pop out extension).  This probably wont\' bother most people, but i noticed this because i am a stroller maniac.2)For very strange reason, when my toddler sits squarely upright in it, only the back of his feet touch  the footrest (as opposed to the middle of the feet).  This could have been easily fixed in design/manufacturing if inglesina is aware of it.  I would not even noticed it until my verbal toddler told me that it was strange that his feet did not rest comfortably.  They jut out and then hang pass the footrest.Also, as with many other umbrella strollers with adjustable leg rest, the leg rest stick straight out when the stroller is initially unfolded.  This means you have to bend down and push it down before your toddler can climb/sit in the stroller.  I find it annoying.  I prefer the maclaren legrest, where this step is not necessary due to the mechanism used.So I prefer the inglesina swift for it\'s lightweghtedness(13.5LB) and the almost perfect canopy(however, it needs a viewing window)When both inglesina models are stacked against maclarens,  Maclaren quest and techno XT still wins because of better manuverbility.  But again, you may not notice unless you compared them side by side.  Maclarens, though, need to add pop out sun visor to the quest model.The handles are good height for average tall people.  I am only 5\' and I find the handles are 1"" too tall for me.There are huge price difference between the inglesinas and maclarens.  So, go with the inglesinas if you like the features and are happy with a little less manuverbility and if cost is a factor.  Both inglesina swift and trip have large frames like the maclaren techno XT.  Maclaren quest has smaller frame and small wheels, but surprisingly, more easy to steer.  Also, although, the inglesina trip has larger frame then quest, the seats are 3/4""  less wide.So, overall, I give credit to inglesina for attempting to produce a beautiful and budget friendly stroller.",3

"4090","OsoCozy Flushable Diaper Liners","We have now tried 2 liners, the Bummis Bio-Soft and OsoCozy Flushable liners, both in size large.  We typically cut them in half to double our usage and they still cover ~80% of the diaper (the most critical part.)  In the size department, they are nearly the same.  We have also never had any skin reaction with either liner, so this seems to be a moot point.The difference comes in the texture and reliability.  I do think the OsoCozy are slightly softer (they feel kind of slick, very comfortable), but because of this we can\'t get them to stay put in the diaper.  They always seem to slide around and we find it only partially covering the area where we originally placed it.  This also means it only partially captures the poop...defeating the purpose of the liner.  The Bummis on the other hand has a slightly rougher texture (but NOT ROUGH, it is still plenty comfortable to the point that I don\'t worry about my baby\'s skin) so it stays in place no matter how much moving around he does.  So after he poops, we find the Bummis exactly where we placed it and have a much higher success rate with % of poop captured.  By cutting the large sheets in half, we always risk a little bit of squeeze out around the edge (but still contained within the diaper), but I find this a small price to pay to double our usage of a roll.  I would say 90% of the time we get full capture with the Bummis, and only about 10% of the time with the OsoCozy...a huge difference!  (If we used a full OsoCozy sheet and didn\'t fold it, I think we could keep the liner in place due the leg elastic in the diaper, but this is not necessary with the Bummis, so I\'m trying to compare apples to apples.)On liners in general: We were getting very tired of scooping out poop 3 times a day after he started solids, and were almost ready to throw in the towel on cloth diapering.  But cloth seems to work so much better than disposables (for us at least), and they don\'t immediately smell like pee when he goes #1 like a disposable does.  So we bought the liners and will never look back...it saved our cloth diapering process and we\'re back to loving it!  For what it\'s worth, we use Charlie Banana one-size during the day and a double-stuffed Bum Genius at night and have had very few issues.  We would highly recommend the Charlie Bananas in conjunction with Bummis Bio-Soft liners.",2

"4099","Go Mama Go Designs 38 Pack Wonder Bumpers, Pink/Chocolate","I got these for a 6-7 month old who was learning to stand and cruise (and therefore fall, ouch).Although I couldn\'t put these all the way around, and left short one side wholly without (or else the mattress would not come out any more), this has so far prevented a lot of painful bumps on the head, and also seems to help keep limbs from sticking dangerously out between crib slats. And they do prevent gnawing on the wood.I also left off a couple along the main long side, to serve as &#34;windows&#34; to the outside.They work so well the crib occupant may not learn caution in moving around! Also, I am not totally convinced it\'s okay to press the face up against these, so I\'m glad to have waited til the occupant was more responsive to airflow issues, and also have installed a breathing monitor (under-mattress dual-pad sensor system) as well.If there is one annoying factor, it\'s that they really are annoying to wash, as others have noted. Not only did the foam escape from the covers, but the zipper clacking caused me visions of flaking appliance enamel (luckily has not happened yet). I wound up washing half a dozen at a time, with lots of old towels as padding. Washing/drying did help get rid of the &#34;newly manufactured&#34; smell.",5

On our third attempt, my son figured it out and now it\'s the only cup he wants to drink out of.  The design means that he can get a drink without having to tilt the cup up.  My only caveat with this cup is that it\'s expensive, but it seems to be standing up to wear and tear fairly well.  I hand wash it and let it air dry between uses.

"4105","We Sell Mats Anti-Fatigue 6 Piece Interlocking EVA Foam Flooring Set","We bought 10 packs of these mats to create a large play area in our unfinished basement.  The basement was a pretty traditional unfinished basement though the concrete floor had been painted grey which made it somewhat slippery.  Putting down the mats to create 240sqft of playroom floor.  The kids love it it takes the edge off of the ""hardness"" of the concrete but isn\'t overly squishy when you walk around.  My son can roll out his hot wheels rug and play cars without complaining about about being uncomfortable from sitting on the hard concrete.  As a matter of fact their Xbox and Kinect is in the basement, and after playing some games with them, I think the padding works better for gripping in sock feet than the carpet did in our living room and the fatigue on the knees from games like Kinect sports are much improved even though the pads are slightly less than 1/2"" thick.  Additionally the mats have stayed put as I was afraid they may skid and slide on the painted floor surface.  My other reservation was if 3/8"" was thick enough but in the end it has worked out very well.  I wouldn\'t recommend this thickness for martial arts or wrestling but for kids play area it is more than adequate.  I am now contemplating ordering some of the 3/8"" mats with the carpet on them for a home theater area in the same basement, and I definitely plan to order some more of the foam mats in brown to take camping with us.  Normally we put down carpet/rugs on the floor of of our tent to level out the floor and provide some insulation from the cool ground in the morning and most importantly protect the tent floor from accidental tears from dropped items or scooted/dragged suit cases etc.  I think these tiles are an even better solution as they are water resistant especially compared to carpet, and easily cleanable.  I am sure they can provide even more insulation from a potentially cold ground and when it is time to leave just pick them up and stick them back in the car.",NA

"4107","Ju-Ju-Be Be Hip Bag, Brown/Bubblegum","Bought one in Dizzy Daisies not my top choice but I figured I wouldn\'t have OCD print placement issues with this print, yet when it arrived I just couldn\'t stop admiring it! It\'s gorgeous! Its material is akin to those of regular JJB bags not the BeLight nor MightyBe, so the fabric is stiffer and denser. The changing pad looks like that of the BeLight (print on top, plain satin on underside), same size, but the print fabric is slightly heavier. Strap doesn\'t look like it\'s long enough that\'s because the bag is long. I\'m 5\'5"" and the right length of strap is just a few inches up from the shortest setting. While the bag does look a tad long on me, I like how convenient it is to fish something out quickly without having to deal with a large top flap that could get in the way like that of the Be All, nor fight with a zipper closure in the wrong direction for me.With respect to capacity, it holds as much as I can carry in my BFF without having to stuff it to its seams.When you lift the flap up there\'s a zipped pocket above the front pockets and is lined with sunglass protective material. Inside the main section are 2 elastic topped mesh pockets and a zipped pocket directly above them, and is about half a hand deep. The lining of the top flap is satin while those of the pockets and main section are of crinkly crumply nylon which does look a little cheap but for the low price you\'re paying it\'s alright. The front pockets have poppers to secure them shut and they are a little tricky to snap close when the pockets are full. Otherwise they\'re fine. Not at all a big deal for such a lovely bag. If you\'re new to JJB this is one bag you don\'t have to splurge on to sample its awesomeness.As for shipping, I ordered this directly from Amazon, sent by Amazon\'s Free Super Saver shipping and it arrived 2 days earlier than scheduled. How wonderful, as I was so looking forward to receiving this. Definitely a keeper.",4

It\'s more forgiving than a metal gate when he topples over.  Also more sturdy than plastic gates.  The door is a great bonus. My only concern is that it moves a little when someone tries to pick him up over the gate.  So I\'m sure as he gets older he will be strong enough to move it himself.  But I\'m sure other gates do the same, especially flimsy plastic gates.  Overall I am pleased with this purchase.",5

When I received it in the mail, I was baffled. My wife has the older version on the LX 65 and I bought this version because I like the new design element of the release on the handle. Anyway, I called them and asked what had happened. They were very skeptical and said &#34;there is no way we could have sent that one, since we don\'t even have it in our system. Email us picture so we can see what you are talking about.&#34; I did. I had to call them two days later to ask if they received my pictures. They said they did and found that they DID send the incorrect car seat and don\'t know how or why, but they are currently out of stock of the one I ordered (THIS ONE!)They said they can refund me or send me this one when they get it in stock, I opted to wait for when they restocked because I figured that would be the fastest option. So I had to use my time to go to the FedEx office to ship their false advertised product back to them! Not to make this even more dramatic, but with a sick kid i had to carry around! They said it would be in early the following week. After receiving no call Monday or Tuesday that week. (They told me it would go out Tuesday.) I called on Wednesday to see how it was progressing. I was told that they didn\'t even have the one I ordered and that they put into the computer system incorrectlyI They said they would send me a refund. I ordered from another company.They continue to post this picture and product description. They got two stars only because they didn\'t steal my money. They did steal time, trust, and I guess money since I had to drive up to the FedEx store to resend their product.

It works much better than Stokke\'s baby rail at containing her!  The baby rail is so awkwardly placed it means scraping her legs thru the openings to get her seated, and bending her legs in weird directions.The tray just fits over the top of the upside-down sevens that make up the sides of the chair- easy on and easy off.  And since you put on after baby is already seated, no crying involved!For feeding her, it\'s great.  It has a nice lip around the edge.  I also like that\'s clear because I can see thru to her lap.  It\'s all one piece so it makes it really easy to soap down for the next meal.  There is also a strap that - I think- could go from the tray to the between the legs position on the seat.  I haven\'t used it as a kept the seat back and harness from the Stokke baby rail.The only improvement they could make in my book is it would be neat to have some way to hang the tray from the back of the chair when not in use.",5

"4162","The First Years Extra Tall Decor Gate","I put the gate up recently and it was pretty easy to install.  I wanted a walk through gate and it had to be wide for the opening between kitchen and great room.  The gate is sturdy and seems very secure with just the pressure mounting.  I looked at dozens of gates online and in person before I purchased this one.  I find the walk through door to be very spacious.  We are using the gate for our puppy, but I do think it would safely contain any active toddler.  The only issue with the gate is my husband keeps stubbing his toe on the bottom bar.  You just have to get used to stepping over it.....it\'s only about an inch high.  I would highly recommend the gate for quality,  aesthetics and function.",5

"4175","Dr. Brown\'s BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Standard Neck Bottle, 4 oz - 3-Pack","As with most things touted as a miracle cure for your baby, the hype is a bit overblown.  This bottle does help but doesn\'t end reflux altogether.My three-month-old daughter has had reflux issues since she was born.  She\'s almost exclusively breastfed, except for one or two bottles a day of expressed milk. I thought I\'d give the Dr. Brown\'s bottles a go, after feeding her from Born Free and Medela bottles with no discernible difference in her spitting up.  With the Dr. Brown\'s bottles, we did find that she spits up slightly less.  Does she still spit up?  Sure -- just not quite as much.I wash these bottles in the dishwasher (top rack), and haven\'t had a problem with them leaking.  Yes, there are a number of pieces that have to be cleaned for each bottle, but there are no more pieces than the Born Free bottles, and in the dishwasher it\'s not a big deal.  And even the times I\'ve washed them by hand, having to wash a few pieces and use the enclosed brush hasn\'t been onerous.  If she were exclusively bottle-fed and I didn\'t have a dishwasher, I can see where these bottles might seem like a pain, but otherwise they aren\'t that time-consuming.A lot of the comments on the Dr. Brown\'s bottles seem to come down to a question of parenting style.  If you\'re the type of parent who values convenience above all things because you\'re dealing with a needy baby, especially if you don\'t have a dishwasher, you may well dislike the Dr. Brown\'s bottles (my friends in this camp rave about the Playtex dropins).  If you\'re instead the type of parent who doesn\'t mind an extra minute or less loading the dishwasher and an extra 5 seconds in assembling a bottle, if it means your child with reflux will spit up a bit less, I recommend trying one of the Dr. Brown\'s bottles to see if it helps your baby.",4

So it is important to always be prepared and have clean clothes, a couple diapers, and plenty of wipes.  The Skip Hop Pronto fits the bill well.The best thing about it is the size--it is plenty big enough to have a good working area with a 2 year old.  There are two handles on it: a grab handle up top, and one with a clip, so it can be attached to a stroller.  Inside are a few pockets and the wipes container.  There isn\'t a ton of room, but enough for the items I talked about above.All in all, a good transition from a full diaper bag, and great to keep in the car.",NA

The day we brought home our second baby, my firstborn gave it to her sister as a gift to ""help her sleep"".And it worked!  Now, my 4 month old is ALSO addicted to this blanket, and will not sleep without it.  I searched high and low for this - I had to google the tag.  I am so glad I found it.  This morning was a major crisis in our house because I put it in the wash and baby got tired and started screaming (for her blankie).I have used SEVERAL loveys with both my girls (the blankies with animal heads; the taggies blankies, etc).

"4200","Natural Touch Silicone Bottle Medium Flow, 7 Ounce","I totally recommend this bottle, I\'ve always loved it. Originally I bought it at Target for my first son when I had to go back to work. So I got to see it up close before buying it which was 3 years ago. These bottles are SO easy to clean. I had used it on 3 kids. What I loved so much about it is the whole bottle is silicone. Not just the nipple, I had to use it for a baby that wasn\'t my own, who refused to drink from a bottle. And so the good thing to me was that I could squeeze the bottle and it would push the breast milk out. Which worked great to make him learn to take the bottle. ( some babies are harder at taking a bottle when they\'re breast fed exclusively). My first son I had no problems with, if there was milk coming out he would drink it, not picky at all. My youngest son still a baby, This is the only bottle that he\'s latched on to the best, I had to have some surgery when he was 3 months old so while the meds they gave me wore off he had to drink from a bottle for the first time, and he did great with this bottle, it wasn\'t too fast like some of the other post have stated out here. But at the same time. All babies are different, and handle bottles differently. That\'s why there are so many types of bottles. Everybody has their preference. I love this bottle. My kids have also done great when they need the bottle and I only use these bottles but also breast feed. Love it.",5

Constant static and way too unreliable to monitor a precious baby. I immediately took it back for a refund.

"4207","Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White","I just tried to install this gate this past weekend.  It had a great price (at a local store), and I\'ve used Regalo\'s hook-on dining chairs (with satisfaction).  However, I was disappointed in this gate for a couple of reasons (noted below).  I have a KidCo Center Gateway installed on the bottom of my stairs - and it is truly pressure mounted - no screwing/nailing involved.  However, the Kidco is ""short"" or regular sized.  I haven\'t tried any other brand of gate.Cons:*This is not a truly pressure gate as the description says.  You have to put screws in your wall to install little cups on the wall.  The description says how easy it is to put and take down - ummmm - are you going to put these screws in the wall everywhere you go?  The directions say many times you have to mount these screws/cups.*Installed without the screws/cups and pressure mounted as tight as I could (I did not need an extension)...the gate seemed flimsy for a toddler to stand there and shake/rattle it.  I think the handle/locking-mechanism could be designed better to make it more solid when closed.*The gate opening is not very wide (although I think I read that up front or in a review somewhere else)...the Kidco gate is nice and wide (although shorter)Pros:*The price and size*I imagine this would be good for medium to small animals (not sure about large) - I\'m just guessing.*One small extension comes with it.I\'m returning this gate - I just don\'t feel its going to hold up and be safe enough for my toddlers (without putting holes in my wall).  However, if you are getting this for animals or for some other reason where there won\'t be much wear and tear...or you don\'t mind putting holes in your wall...this gate might work for you!",NA

I think this is perfect for every child to have their own place to sit in the living room. I\'m not a fan of those cheaper chairs/couches with characters on it, so this was perfect for us.

"4215","Snuggin Go Infant Positioner, Black","I bought this product prior to a 5-hour plane trip from Michigan to California, concerned about baby having to spend so much time in a car seat. It was worth it. My baby did not cry or fuss at all, and slept peacefully for most of the flight. I think the infant positioner had a lot to do with it, because I could see she was comfy and breathing well. Baby\'s posture also allowed me to feed her a bottle without having to remove her from the seat. At our destination, the positioner was used with the stroller, because baby was small for the stroller seat. With the Snuggin\'Go, she would not ""sink"" in the seat, and the straps fit much better. 4 months later, baby is now bigger, but if the fit is ok, I plan on using it again on a coming 12-hour overseas plane trip.",NA

I have no complaints about my older model, but I thought being able to use my phone as a baby monitor would be handy.  No, it really wasn\'t.  What I found is that with my older model, I could just set the monitor down where I was and not worry about it.  However with my phone it was hard to set it someplace I could see it comfortably.  As a camera it\'s great.  It\'s clear, has a reasonable range of zoom, and the night vision is very good.  But as far as I can tell, it\'s pretty much the same camera I have.  If there is a difference, it\'s not obvious to me.So for a baby monitor I would go with theMotorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 2.8 Inch LCDor perhaps the newerMotorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch LCD.  I can personally attest that those are great cameras.  I could see this being a handy camera for slightly older kids that you just wanted to peak in on once in a while.

It\'s durable and easy to clean, the Velcro hasn\'t worn out yet and it\'s small enough that it doesn\'t swallow him up like the bigger feeding bibs that are out there. Obviously when her gets bigger I will have to get him bigger ones, but for now it\'s just perfect. I keep one with his high chair and another in my diaper bag since it\'s small, flexible and easy to fold up to take along. I wish I\'d had a couple of these with my older three kids!",5
"4222","UPPAbaby Vista Stroller, Red/Denny","My baby is 3 months old now and I am so happy that I have this stroller!  My little girl has slept in the bassinet on the stroller next to my bed every night since we came home from the hospital and she is now three months old.  Target has bassinet sheets and bassinet matress protectors so she always has a clean bed.  As a result, I did not have to buy a cosleeper.  This stroller works great as a stroller too!  It is so smooth and easy to roll, there is no worry about popping a tire because of the way the wheels are made.  The super sunshade protects my baby when we are outside.  Plus, breaking this stroller down to fit in my car is so easy and fast.  My little girl is very comfortable when she lays in the bassinet while being pushed.  I have only used the bassinet so far and it has been great.  I\'m sure the seat will work well too when she is ready for it.",5

"4224","Arm\'s Reach Concepts Mini Arc Convertible Co-Sleeper Bassinet, Java Dot","I spent an inordinate amount of time researching cosleepers and finally decided to go with this one.  It took a bit of time and two people to set up and attach to the bed, but once it is there, it\'s there.  It is secure and convenient.  My only complaint is that when in the co-sleeper stage, the bottom is not accessible.  It would be nice if there was access so that we could store diapers and blankets.  As it is, it is just wasted space.",4

My favorites are Charlie Banana and TotsBots - both dry very fast, without any dryer, within 3-4 hours. Blueberry needs longer, but they are good too.

It met all my expectations for a relatively cheaper monitor all for $100. The camera set is not portable so it needs to be plugged in to work, but the monitor can be used without a power cord. I can\'t believe how clear the video was until I saw it for myself. The video is very smooth. I was worried there would be the beeping problem that a few users commented on, but this was not true. I\'m glad this company fixed this fault and provided me with a reliable and sturdy monitor to keep my 8 month old always under watch.",5

I bought it for him when he was 4 months old and had to put a pillow under his feet so he could stand (he\'s in the 95th percentile for height).  No big deal, because he still loved being in it, even though he hadn\'t mastered the jumping part yet.  Well, now he\'s learned to jump in it, and absolutely loves it.  He has never been a baby that could just sit still in a swing or exersaucer.  He HAS to be moving, and this jumperoo does the trick.  Our little adrenaline junkie loves all the toys too.  He loves to play with them during his jumping breaks.  Finally, the music is quite enjoyable.  It\'s not annoying like some of the other baby toys I\'ve heard.  I actually sing the songs to him all day long--they\'re very catchy!  So far, I haven\'t experienced any problems with this jumperoo, and I would buy it again.",5

"4239","Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This swing is great!  It turns three ways, doesn\'t take up that much space, and goes all night long when plugged in.  We use it more than anything for our newborn to sleep in.  He sleeps so well in it!  He also sits and watches the mobile and stars for hours.  When he is fussy I turn on the mobile, lights and music, and he calms right down and watches the show, eventually falling asleep.  We received it as a baby shower gift, never got a gift receipt, and had the swing motor go out after only 3 months of using it.  I called Fisher Price and they where so nice!  They sent out a whole new motor casing right away, free of charge, and now it is still going strong 5 months later!  The swing has many different speed settings, so it\'s perfect for play and sleep.  Lots of different songs and nature sounds too.  My only complaints: It could be more padded so it\'s more comfortable for baby to sleep in. (We added an extra back and neck pad for ours) and also the motor casing is pretty hard and hands on to replace.  Took me a good hour if not more.  Other than that, this is such a great swing!",5

I wanted a way to clean my pump parts that didn\'t require me parading them around and rinsing them in the kitchen sink in the breakroom.  I know that Medela products can be more expensive than some others, but I think these are worth the money.  I\'ve bought other wipes that were much cheaper but were also much smaller - I like that these are pretty big and also that they come individually packaged.  It makes it really easy to just throw them in my pump bag and grab one at a time to use as needed.  Highly recommend!",5
"4242","Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","I bought this seat for my four old. She grew out of the britax roundabout convertible car seat, but she wasn\'t quite ready for a booster weighing only 30pds. The seat colors are really cute, plenty of room to grow. I like that we are able to keep her in a 5 point harness. The harness has plenty of slack and the headrest adjustment is only the 2nd notch, with two more to go. I also like that this is the last car seat I will buy, it converts to a high back booster and then just the seat booster. The only down side to this is that it is heavy. Highly recommend.",3

It has the 5 point harness system and then eventually moves up to being just a booster seat for when they get older. The price is great and the padding is decent. It seems to be holding up well with my active one year old. The color is great for boys and it also has a cup holder which is very convenient. Good value for your money.",NA

These are a great for a young baby on the go for storing homemade purees and other start foods.  They are pretty small though - I wish we had purchased them when our son was about 6 months, instead of 11 months, as they would have gotten more use!  But we do still use them for storing fruit and other snacks on the go. B ut they no longer hold a whole meal worth of food.  Also, if you take your baby to daycare, you might want to check if glass is allowed - we unfortunately found out it is not due to safety reasons, so we can\'t use it to pack lunch!  Oh well!",NA

This sandbox has no floor, either - be aware of it (you cannot make it a kiddie pool in case you opt out of sand).First and foremost - check if you can find washed river rock or beach sand to buy in your area! Any other kind is highly toxic to your baby/toddler, and I would not want to have my baby spend all day in it in my own back yard. Unfortunately, I was unable to find any in my area, and due to this and the poor quality of this product - it had to go back.",NA
"4257","Fisher-Price Cradle n Swing, My Little Lamb","I think this is probably the best baby swing out there on the market. It is especially great for newborns. My lil\' one sleeps best in this swing because it is so comforting and swaddling-like. Since it is so scooped when in the fully reclined position, I do not have to buckle baby in which is great for sleeping.The only dislikes I have are that when it is in its slowest on position, the swing is still pretty fast. I weight it down with extra blankets/towels to slow down the swing. Also, I wish it had a power extension cord for plug-in like some of the other swings on the market. I also wish the music/mobile stayed on longer without having to be reset, but this isn\'t a huge deal.The cover is extremely soft and cozy and baby likes this.I also got a great deal on this swing through Amazon and saved a ton compared to the big retailers.I would recomend this swing to anyone looking for a swing for a newborn. It looks like it will be good later on too when baby is bigger and the seat is reclined to a more forward position. It is great that the safety bar can come on and off, especially since it isn\'t needed now while baby is so little.BEST SWING OUT THERE!",5
"4258","Pampers Natural Stages Drinking Cup with Airwave Venting System, Stage 5, 9 Ounces, Colors May Vary","We have tried every cup out there and I mean every cup! My son would just refuse every cup until I gave him this one! I waited a bit longer to wean him from his night time bottle...so at 18 months I knew it was time and I was concerned. I meet a mom at the park who told me about pampers stage 4! So I went that day and picked them up! Same day I put all the bottles away! And now my son is bottle free for good! I still read books before bed time and give him some milk in the sippie cup (just brish teeth after) he loves it and since his still teething a bit the soft nipple is perfect to bite a bit and doesn\'t seem like it will break.I do agree I wish there were more colors and that the handles came off, although he seems to like the hanles.

He would spend so much time jumping up and down, and even side ways. The higher he jumped, the more he laughed. The legs kind of fold together so you can fit it through narrow doorways if you need to move it from room to room, which I did. It\'s a little awkward trying to carry it, but not too bad. I like the height adjustment too. He has been able to use this for a long time (he is 10 months now). We have a new baby cousin waiting for her turn to use it!",5

It does have a slight learning curve when first wrapping oneself and the baby... once mastered it\'s a breeze.  Comfortable to wear - baby is snug and secure, held close to the wearer in a ""swaddled"" fashion.  The best thing is one is free to move about with complete use of one\'s arms.  I personally tried it with my two year old grandson ""just to see how it worked"". It was secure and he seemed quite comfortable (as far as a ""sequestered"" two year old can be for Grandma\'s little experimental trial) and remarkably comfortable for me as he is a ""big boy"" - tall and lanky for his age.Absolutely would purchase for every new Mom!",5
"4267","Dutailier Round Back Cushion Design Modern Glider Multiposition, Recline and Ottoman Combo, Light Brown","This is a great chair, but just a little low to the ground.  I purchased the chair after having several surgeries, and I needed something small that would fit in my room and give me several options for sitting.  Sometimes I find the chair hard to get in and out of, because it is low to the floor and my knees don\'t want to work.  Also, the handle broke off the first time I sat in it, but the selling is replacing it (haven\'t received it yet, but I\'m told it has been shipped).Even so, I would buy the chair again.  I like that the back lays back some, I like that the stool is so comfortable.  I would recommend to the manufacturer that a little more padding be put in the bottom of the chair, but then I probably sit in it way more than most people would.",4
"4268","Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","I use this as a gate to keep my dog in the arctic entryway, a very high traffic area in our house with people coming and going through it multiple times per day. Previously, we just had the regular wooden expand-o gate that had to be physically moved and re-mounted each time you wanted to access the entryway. This was a particular pain when lugging groceries or other junk to and from the house, while also battling an excited dog!I didn\'t realize non-invasive &#34;mountable&#34; hinged gates existed, but am SO GLAD I found this option! It took less than 10 minutes to install and does not require any screwing into walls if you don\'t want to (the box does include little &#34;cups&#34; you can screw to secure the gate). Simply using the pressure from the arms of the gate itself is more than enough to support constant use and abuse. My dog is constantly jumping up on the gate with her front paws and the thing is still standing strong with no marks or anything on the door frame.This gate is slightly more money than the usual wooden expand-o gates but ABSOLUTELY worth every dime. It is sturdy and easy to install. I will never own any other type of gate!",5
"4269","Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor, Sliver/White","I really like this product when it is working.  I love having the video component to the monitor.  There are some problems with bad reception at times, but otherwise it works well - until it doesn\'t work.  I bought my first one a year ago (in December).  It lasted until April when it just stopped working.  Summer Infant sent me a replacement product, but the one I received was defective.  There was audio but it was so quiet that I had to hold it to my ear to hear if my child was making any noise.  I tried to make it work because I didn\'t want to complain again, but I had to use a second audio monitor so that I would hear it at night.  I called and they sent me a second replacement, which I received in June, and now the video has gone out.  Customer Service is not very friendly, but they have always replaced the product for me.  At this point I\'m not sure if it\'s even worth getting another replacement.",1
"4270","Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso","We bought this crib to replace a drop-side one that had been given to us, as drop-side cribs have been recalled. This crib looks great in our baby\'s room and will be useful for many, many years to come! It took my husband 30-45 minutes to disassemble the old crib and put together the Graco Lauren crib in its place. It appears to be solid wood and has a springy mattress platform. The unfortunate thing is that we have a motion monitor that will not work with the springy platform so we will be cutting a piece of plywood to put over that, but that is a minor inconvenience. This is a beautifully made crib and was well worth the cost! You can see the bolt connection points (no little wood cap cover), but that would be the only aesthetic issue. Also, I had to open the window to let the room air out as the bed has a smell of varnish or something, but that has faded. Like another reviewer said, the box came looking like someone drop-kicked it all the way from China, but the contents were not damaged at all. Overall, I would definitely suggest this crib! (We also bought the Sealy soy & latex foam core mattress and it fits perfectly!)",5

"4272","Safety 1st Perfect Fit Gate","We bought this gate after having the first years all clear swing gate which we loved. We looked at this one at BRU and it seemed fine for $10 cheaper than the other. We hardwear mounted it in a doorway, just like the other one is. As another reviewer mentioned, we had the same problem in that this gate seemed to expand every single time it was used, making it so you had to readjust it every single time in order to use it! This really makes the idea of a baby gate pointless to me, as if I wanted to go through all that hassle I could just buy a cheaper pressure mount gate that I  would need to readjust each time I wanted to go through. Don\'t waste your money on this- spend the extra $10 on the first years one which is extraordinary.",1

I called Fisher Price and the part is on backorder til mid- May. I guess I just got a lemon because everyone else\'s seem to be fine. I am TRULY disappointed in Fisher Price.

"4282","Safety 1st Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat, Lamont","This is the second AOE 3in1 that I have purchased. They are easy to install and easy to operate on a daily basis. The price is great for the features you get. There are a few downsides: 1. Cover cannot be completely removed for cleaning unless you know what you are doing and have some needle nose pliers. 2. Side impact protection isn\'t as fancy as some other models. 3. For a smaller rear facing baby, there isn\'t enough built in recline. You have to use a noodle under the seat to get it anywhere near level. Overall I would (and have) purchased this seat again.",4

"4286","Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy","I have no idea why but my son adores this toy.  He loved this toy months before he even noticed other toys.  It was one of the few things that would keep him happy in the car (he hates the carseat).  We have two other similar Lamaze toys and while he likes them too, they did not have the same effect as this one.  I think it\'s the large eyes.",5
"4287","Britax B-Safe Infant Car Seat, Black","After lots of shopping around, my husband and I decided on the Britax B-Safe. Little did we know that our little baby boy would come 7 weeks early weighing 4 pounds 10 ounces. This car seat was perfect for our baby because it held babies starting at 4 pounds. It\'s sturdy, easy to use, has great color and is easy to install. It is a little big for a smaller SUV but for what you\'re getting, it\'s worth it. Overall, great price for a great product. We also bought the Britax B-Ready stroller which goes great with the car seat.",5

I am very pleased. ;o)",5
"4290","Fisher-Price Precious Planet Portable High Chair Cover, Blue","I love that this high chair cover folds up to a compact size. I can actually fit it in my purse or diaper bag.

"4291","The Ultimate Baby Wrap in Navy","I bought this infant carrier because of the rave reviews it got. What a mistake. After attempting to get the thing strapped on me tightly about 20 times and putting my baby in then out then in again then out again...my baby was still in no way properly supported by this stretchy piece of fabric. I had to hold my baby the entire time she was in it because it felt like she was going to fall right out. Not only that, but in the picture, it looks like a classy and neat navy sling. In reality, it is a faded blue that, when wrapped around you, looks sloppy and bulgy. It\'s still sitting in my house since I never used it at all.",NA

I saw this and thought it would be perfect to strap one of the car seats onto the larger suitcase and have the 3 year old ride in it.  I read the reviews and saw someone said they just used a strap and got some other piece from the hardware store and did it themselves.  Being frugal, I figured I could do the same thing but couldn\'t quite envision what the other person was doing.  We ended up using a cargo strap and it worked out great!  My son loved riding in his seat through the airport and we managed to get everything to/from airplane/cars without an issue.I gave it 2 stars just for the idea.",2

Easy assembly (I did it all myself with no help).  Before I could get him in the seat good he was reaching for the hanging toys.  He\'s not even 6 months yet (but he LOVES to jump), so I had to place a pillow underneath his feet, but he didn\'t care at all.  He started hopping and having a great time!  Within 30 minutes, he had fallen asleep in the jumper!!!  I let him nap, and when he woke up, he smiled at me and started jumping again.  :)  Best purchase ever!",5

"4302","Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers","I originally listed the Sony BabyCall Nursery Monitor on my registry, but received the Sounds n Lights monitor as a gift so decided we would use that.  I have now been using it for 3 months and don\'t know why I have been putting up with it for so long.  From the start it had major static, no matter what channel I had it on.  I\'ve tried many different locations in our bedroom, even tried muffling the static with pillows (which works-sorta but then you risk not hearing the baby\'s cries).  I\'ve tried to tell myself the static is ""white noise"" and it takes a while to fall asleep to but it finally happens....until you get the piercing ringing sound over the static that just won\'t go away.The other night I turned it on at bedtime, heard the static and assumed it was on and working, only to find the following morning the batteries were so low it wasn\'t picking up my son\'s cries at all!  Luckily my son wasn\'t too upset that mommy didn\'t respond to his calls, but all I can think is ""What if....""I am ready to throw this product out the window.  We just put him down for a nap, turned on the monitor and the static is almost unbearable.  As soon as he wakes up we are going to the store to get the Sony BabyCall.  I am not going another night with this monitor!",1
"4303","The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","Before I go on to pros and cons, I researched umbrella strollers before I bought this. I had already decided I needed something with a storage bin, tall handles and a harness, so anything else was just a bonus. This was physically and financially compared in person, and online to several other brands. I have had this stroller for two months, we have gone to farmers markets, the beach, malls, we live on a road that does not have paved side walks, and other little travels.Pros:1. I\'m 5\'9"" and Dad is 6\'7"" - I have had no issues with kicking the wheels. My back doesn\'t hurt from hunching after a walk. Dad has some issues but in reality, normal people just aren\'t that tall (haha.).2. While it\'s a simplistic design for reclining, the seat DOES recline. It doesn\'t recline too much but enough to make a comfortable position for the head while the child takes a nap.3. It has a basket!4. The assembly was INCREDIBLY simple.5. The handles are made of foam, which is not only comfortable but doesn\'t get slippery when your hands sweat.6. It holds up to 50lbs! This is awesome for people who want to make a purchase that will last.7. A FIVE POINT HARNESS - you can not go wrong with this, your child can\'t lean forward and topple out.8. It\'s STURDY, there are absolutely no flimsy parts. The material is thick and high quality.9. When the umbrella is folded up, it doesn\'t fall down, no matter how rugged the ride gets.10. It holds it\'s own on paved roads with sand (imagine a sidewalk that goes to the beach and has sand on it, it doesn\'t jam the wheels...just don\'t take it on full sand), it rolls great on gravel.11. The mom pouch is awesome! It really was a big bonus! I keep my coffee mug, a bottle, car keys, my wallet an a bag of snacks for him in it.12. I have a small car and this does not take up much room in the trunk!Cons:1. The basket is not easily accessed. There is NO WAY you can fit a full sized diaper bag in it. You can throw a sweater in there and diaper changing materials but that is about it.That is about it :) I posted some pictures also, so you can see what I am referring to with the basket, the mom pouch and the harness.",4

"4308","Levana Safe N\'See Digital Video Baby Monitor with Talk-to-Baby Intercom and Lullaby Control (LV-TW501)","We originally bought one 2 years ago and liked it so we bought another one for grandparent\'s place. Shortly after, our 1st monitor kept freezing and the temperature gauge was off by 6+ degrees instead of the 2-3 variance per the user guide. Turns out the 1st one was the 1st version and had some issues (when you open the back where there battery is, it will say V-1, V-2, etc...) so we just returned it and bought our 3rd through Amazon and it\'s the same version as the 2nd (V-5) and they were both working fine for a while. Once in a blue moon it freezes not often so it doesn\'t bother us and temperature is working fine until after the warranty expired (1 year). Battery life is now horrible. It doesn\'t hold a charge so it has to stay in the cradle at all times to work for both monitors. Levana says it\'s user error (claims we didn\'t let battery drain after each charge even though we did) so it will cost $30 pluh shipping for a new battery. Day picture is great and is in color but night picture is black and white and is very grainy.",2

I was disappointed with the picture quality. The video is very very grainy and the color looks very dull. It does get the job done, meaning you can see and hear your baby, but the picture isn\'t clear like the description descibes and it DEFINITELY doesn\'t look like the picture.The battery life on the parent device is not bad, it saves your battery life if you turn the picture off when you aren\'t looking at it.Overall, this device is just okay, I would have kept it if the price wasn\'t so high. I went to the store and looked at the Summer Infant in person and that picture is much more clear and cheaper. I definitely recommend looking at this video monitor in person before purchasing if you can.",NA
"4313","Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red","My son is on the small side for a twenty month old boy.  I purchased this product after I realized that he would not use the big potty at his sister\'s swim practice, and he was refusing to wear anything but his big boy pants... They sell this product at a major toy store for very little money so I bought it there.  For putting it on a big potty it works WONDERFUL.  No issues there at all.  The size is great for carrying with you, and the bag that comes with it is a nice touch.  My only issue is that when I set it up as a stand alone potty and my son promplty sat down on it, it collapsed.  I tried it again, same thing (much more reluctant child though).  I was not able to get it to click into place, which is apparently the problem... I do think its worth the money though, especially if you get one that will click into place.  Sure its small, but this is for babies as young as 15 months.. bigger toddlers/pre schoolers will likely need something else.",3

It is so much easier to get the baby in and out of the seat than any other car seat we\'ve used.  Also, velcro tabs hold the harness straps back between uses, helping to keep them from twisting.

Well, it belongs in the recycling container.  The blade/strainer does not stay in place when grinding foods.  We have cleaned up many messes as a result of the blade/strainer popping out.  The seal is marginal at best.  Grinding anything with moisture causes liquid to flow down base and on to the countertop.  Finally, the mill leaves a good portion of unground food.  Easily an inch worth of compressed food is left unground.  Very disappointed. It might make great compost, minus the steel blade.",1

"4322","Baby Delight Snuggle Nest, Green/White","We bought this snuggle nest when our daughter was 7 weeks old. She was only 8.6 pounds and 21 1/2 inches long at the time we purchased it. She is the type of baby who needs to be held 24/7 or else she cries or wakes up. She will not sleep in her bassinet and so we have been putting her in our bed to sleep for the last 7 weeks. We have a king size bed and it\'s still pretty snug with me, my husband, and the snuggle nest. Which we totally love because our daughter will actually sleep in it without waking up!!!I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the night light is super bright and goes off after like a minute. I wish it would stay on until I turned it off.Other than that it is a really great product and I wish we would\'ve known about it sooner!!Update: we used this snuggle nest in our king size bed, on the side of the bed with a bed railing (just in case it moved in the middle of the night...which it never did, but you never know!) until our daughter was 4 months old. At which time we then moved her into her crib in her own room. The snuggle nest was a life saver as I needed to be able to see her at all times and wanted her close by. We even took it with us to people\'s houses so she could take naps in it, as it is totally portable. And we actually used bassinet sheets on it the whole time and just tucked them in really good underneath the pad. It worked just fine for us. Overall, I am so glad we purchased our snuggle nest and would buy another one again in a heart beat!!",4

"4324","MOBI MobiCam System","I almost didn\'t buy this camera based on all the negative reviews up here on Amazon, but I decided to give it shot and as it turned out I am extremely happy with this camera and would highly recommend it to any new parents.No it will not give you an image that is as good as your camcorder. Yes there may be some static and interference in the picture. Yes it may interfere with your wireless network (just turn off the camera whenever you go online, or if you are feeling motivated you can pretty easily tweak your wireless network so they don\'t conflict).But what you *do* get is a self-contained wireless video camera that can shoot in total darkness ... plus a portable battery powered video monitor for only $120. And it actually works and can be set up in a few minutes. That is amazing to me.Also there is an AV Out on the Mobi\'s video monitor so you can run the (included) cable directly from the Mobi monitor to your main TV set. My wife and I usually like to watch one tv show before we go to sleep, this is the one time of day we can relax and just spend time together, and it is extremely useful to be able to just hit a button on the remote and go from ""Project Runway"" to a real time image of our baby sleeping in the next room.You can also set the Mobi monitor to only turn on when there is movement - we set the little Mobi monitor next to our TV so if we see it turn on we can swith the main tv over to see a what is happening on our big screen.We have audio monitors but being able to actually SEE your baby is much, much more helpful. Oftentimes our daughter will fuss silently before actually waking up, so when we see her start to move around we know we need to get ready to deal with her.Also you don\'t need to be ""gadget dad"" to make this work. We just plugged ours in, set the frequency (A, B or C), and it was good to go.So, if you can afford the $120 I would highly recommend this device. It has made us much more effective parents.",5
"4325","Beco Baby Carrier Gemini - Espresso","While it\'s not a bad carrier, my biggest complaint is that even on the widest setting, the bottom of the pouch is not very wide, so the legs of older babies (and by older I really only mean 10 months!) dangle, which isn\'t comfortable or good for them.  The ergo has a much broader base that supports their legs all the way to the knee.  I also don\'t find the Gemini to be as comfortable for me as the Ergo; it\'s just too thickly padded everywhere.  But that\'s personal preference.",3

I\'m curious what is causing this, since the mist is only tap water...nothing else added to the water.  I can easily wipe it off, but it\'s kind of strange that it\'s happening.  Before using this, our air was so dry that I\'d wake up several times at night exceptionally thirsty, and the inside of my nose was super dry.  Now, the air has become so comfortable.  It\'s also nice that the strong static electricity shocks we used to experience from the dry air are gone!The machine is easy to fill and easy to clean.  I clean it every weekend with a vinegar solution to keep mineral build-up to a minimum.",4
"4329","Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Toddler Size 2 - Pack of 2 (Blue, White)","These work well with my flats. I do question whether a ""toddler"" size is neccessary. I don\'t use prefolds because they don\'t wrap around far enough for my preference. Perhaps this is the reason for the toddler size, as it is longer (barely) but not really ""taller"". I use flats, which can be folded to have the flaps come together or even overlap, so the regular size Snappi works fine even on my 35lb boy. I imagine that this would be the case for many contoured dipes as well. Just something to keep in mind depending on what kind of dipes you use, because the toddler size Snappi usually costs more.",5

I was really disappointed with the lack of selection available for second-year calendars in general, so I just got this one because it was one of the only ones. It\'s an okay calendar. The finish on the pages is glossy which makes it hard to write on with certain pens. The stickers aren\'t very cute and the pages are pretty old-fashioned looking. Hopefully they will come out with some other calendars for future purchasers.",NA

It was very easy to assemble, it only took my husband and father in law around 30 minutes to put together.  My son loves his bed!  It fits the mattress from his crib/daybed.",5

She is a belly sleeper and her nose and cheaks were red with regular sheets, but not with these.  I did read others commenting on the smell of these.  They do have a when fresh and hot out of the dryer but it fades.

"4356","Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","This item becomes softer after additional washes and easily survives cleaning.  However, a tight swaddle is needed to ensure that the baby\'s arms don\'t pop out.  It\'s almost too big for most newborns.  A friend of ours supplements with safety pins to ensure that baby doesn\'t escape.  You could save a lot of money by learning to swaddle effectively with a cheaper newborn blanket.",3

If you plan on only feeding finely pureed mush to your baby for several months on end, this might work. MIGHT. Really tho, the hole is so small that getting even mush through it smoothly enough so that it flows into the spoon instead of shooting out of it at high velocity.In other words... It\'s a yuppy toy that doesn\'t quite hit the mark when it comes to taking a good concept and fleshing it out into a usable product.",2

It is not 30 inches long. It is 24 inches. And since it is so bulky it fits almost like a choker. That will be uncomfortable for me because with a baby drooling on you, you want the drool as far away as possible, at least. I guess I will put it around my wrist or loop it onto one of his other toys. It is too much of a hassle to send back. Oh well, you win some you lose some....I lost on this one......",1

With the supplied wall attachments the wood stove, utility room and kitchen are safely blocked. A baby gate covered the other route. The roughest child so far, the 15 month old girl, has tested it tough. She is a dare devil and you have to watch her always. So far she is unable to work the 2 part latching set up.

"4369","WubbaNub Giraffe","I bought this thing because of all of the reviews here AND because we were struggling with our son\'s pacifiers. He would drop every single one and the one he liked he kept in for only a few minutes.  Bottom line, we realized HE DIDN\'T WANT IT. That\'s why he\'d drop it.  We took it away at six weeks and that was the best thing we ever did. We all slept, he was happy, helped with the breast feeding and made our lives much easier.This pacifier kept falling all over the place, he\'d cry some more.  Then I\'d try to give it when he was on his side and still fell off. No matter where my son was this wubbanub didn\'t stay. Furthermore, it was too small and he had a hard time sucking/keeping it in. AUGH how frustrating.  Someone said;OH noooo he needs to have his sucking needs met. Well, he found his hands and consequently his thumb. Not sure if that is great either but I think it is the natural way. Yes, it maybe challenging to weaning of off the thumb, but we thought the paci would be hard and it wasn\'t it. Who knows! Bottom line DO NOT WASTE your money on this pacifier it doesn\'t comes close to ""what they advertise"".",1

"4373","Baby Jogger 2011 City Mini Double Stroller, Black/Black","This is the most amazing stroller ever!! I had been researching double strollers for 2 months for my 3 month old twins and finally decided on the City Mini. We have a tandem car seat stroller for easy trips in and out but it is very comberssome to maneuver and keeping the babies in the car seats made them very hot. If we were on long outings like the farmers market or taking our morning walks it was a pain to use and the kids hated being trapped in the car seats for long periods of time. This stroller is a dream it is completly one hand maneuvering and glides across almost any terrain. I love the vented top section of babies heads an the full recline. My babies are small at three months and they fit very comfortably and enjoy the ride. The large overhead canopies work great and protect them from too much sun exposure. It folds up easily and fits perfec in the back of my car and its not too heavy. I was afraid of the side by side but it has been a non-issue. I have yet to find a door we cannot get through and I can open the door and push them in without help because it so easily manuevers one handed. The only draw back to this stroller is the underneath storage is very small and very hard to access especially when the seats are reclined. Other than that it has been the best 400 bucks we\'ve spent on these babies.. For all the skeptics this stoller is true to its specs, the color is perfect, great in the rain, and has been just a dream!!",NA

Just squares of fabric cut out and roughly (and badly) serged around the edges. Yeah, they are soft, but they are also tiny and feel like they won\'t hold up very long. And again, only fuzzy on one side!Very unhappy with this purchase, they look like something you\'d pick up at the dollar store.Edit: After using these for 7 months I am surprisingly editing my review. These have held up and work very well, staying soft and the serging is not coming undone. My 4 yr old is using them too because she likes them better than our other cloths!",NA

"4380","Fisher-Price Newborn Rock \'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","This was a lifesaver!  I received it at my baby shower and I\'m so glad I did!  My daughter is an extremely high needs baby and for months she wouldn\'t sleep if she wasn\'t on me or my husband.  She also had very bad reflux and the doctor recommended we sit her up for at least 30 min after feeds, which is hard to do with late night feeds.  Eventually, after about 2 1/2 months, she would sleep in here for naps if swaddled tightly.  Eventually she would sleep in here through the night.  The crib was just too much space for her and she would scream her head off the second you put her down.This rocker is incredibly easy to move from room to room, not to mention fold up and take along to family or friends.  It was just what my daughter needed before the transition to the crib.  She is almost 5 months and will still nap in this when we visit family.  My mother and mother-in-law both purchased one for their homes so we didn\'t have to worry about bringing ours since we\'re there so often.I would HIGHLY recommend this product for any baby!  It\'s convenient, folds pretty flat which was great because I have a very small apartment, and gently rocks itself with baby\'s movement.  My daughter figured out how to push herself up to rock herself back to sleep.  I was afraid this would make the transition to the crib harder, but instead, when she was ready for the crib it just happened.  And her first night in the crib she slept through the night!",5

The brush comes in two pieces, so once it is put together, you can easily clean any baby bottles, sippy cups or travel mugs.  There is also room to store a small bottle of dish soap, mini sponge, and travel cutlery in the travel container.  When opened, the travel box becomes a small, but incredibly functional drying rack.

Let me explain, this bouncer is modern, looks great, babies love it for the first 2 months but then after that it gets kind of boring cause there are no toys attached to it, you need to buy a $50 toy bar which in my opinion is kind of lame and overpriced. For less than half the price you can get the FisherPrice Snugabunny bouncer which actually bounces, vibrates, has music and toys and is as comfortable as the Babybjorn one.",3

Overall, the Safety 1st product functions well. Although it has a couple disadvantages, these can be overcome with ""hacks.""ADVANTAGES:  It\'s easy to put the two halves together by matching tabs to slots. Once assembled, it generally prevents children from turning the doorknob while allowing adults to do so by simultaneously pressing the two ""buttons"" on the sides and twisting.DISADVANTAGE #1: It\'s easier for a child to separate the two halves of the Safety 1st than the Kidco, for example by slamming the door (as stated on another Web site), or by pressing at just the right points in just the right way. ""HACK"" #1: Use a strong glue (likeHenkel 01-82196 Loctite 2-Gram Super Glue Gel) on the tabs to keep the cover intact (but not so much glue that you won\'t be able to remove the cover later!).DISADVANTAGE #2: On certain doorknobs, the pads inside the cover might grip the knob too tightly, so that a child will be able to open the door with only moderate effort. ""HACK"" #2: Apply a small amount of silicone lubricant (like10141WD 11oz 3-in-1 Pro Lubricant Silicone Spray Aerosol Can *SHIP GROUND ONLY* ORM-D) to the pads inside.Buy this from Amazon.com!",4

"4425","Bummis Organic Cotton Diaper Kit, 8-15 Pounds","This is a great kit for those wanting to cloth diaper. I had bought this having no clue what I was looking for and was very pleased.  I have used these from the beginning and are well loved. I did find that 36 prefolds is MORE than enough. I wash every 2-3 days and never ran out of prefolds or covers for my baby.  I did however, purchase some thirsties covers, so I could have a variety of colors!  The prefolds are also unbleached indian prefolds and super soft and fluffy!!Now that my LO is about to outgrow these, I have been using the prefolds inside the BG and fuzzi bunz diapers as inserts, especially overnight with no added bulkiness. These prefolds have gotten plenty of use and more than paid for themselves!Also do practice a variety of folds.  The fold in the Bummis directions is designed more for a girl with the added absorbancy in the middle.  For a boy you want to fold up the front and do an angel wing fold to have more absorbancy in the front.  I have noticed when I do the fold in the directions teh diapers are soaked very quickly and when I do teh angel fold they aren\'t soaked through...so do practice.",5

This diaper also works great for my 30lb toddler with a little room to grow. This is the absolute trimmest diaper we have, it fits under everything.  The PUL on this diaper is so silky soft as is the bamboo fleece inner. I love the fleece leg gussets. We never have red marks with this diaper unlike most of our others. The JoeyBunz insert is amazing. I holds so much. We travel a lot and this is always the first diaper I reach for when I know we will be in the car for an extended period. We never have leaks. The side snaps make changing my very wiggly kids super easy. My youngest likes to flip to her belly mid diaper change and I have no problems securing this when she does her flip. This diaper does take a bit longer to dry than some of our others but the fact that there is all natural fibers against my baby\'s skin makes it well worth the wait. I have experimented with the newborn feature and I am excited to try it on our next child. It takes a minute to fold it down but the diaper gets super small and I have no doubt it would fit from bith. I really can\'t say enough good things about this diaper, it really is my favorite.",5

I found this to be amazing when you went to the store or out to eat because the baby is all cozy next to you.  It takes some practice to learn to tie anything you haven\'t tied before... there is no instant gratification but honestly it took less than 2 minutes for me to tie.  I tied this in the house before I went out and then when I was where I wanted to go I just popped the baby from his car seat into the moby.

Still didn\'t work so I requested a refund which Amazon credited back to my account before I even returned it.  By luck, my wife pressed one of the sound selection and turned it on.  It came alive again.This is my 1st review for any products.  I think that this unit deserves a better review with all the negative ones out there saying how it eats up the batteries so quickly.  The unit plays for about 15 minutes and would stop.  You have to press on one of the sound selection again for it to play again.  The button is in the front: Bach, Mozart, or Nature.

We have had absolutely NO interference with our WiFi, which several other brands have been known to have.  We just received our second camera in the mail and the scanning feature works great!  As the monitor scans from camera to camera the sound follows.  I read a few reviews on other products that said the video was the only thing that scanned and the audio stayed on the first camera.  The camera works great in both dark and light rooms and we love the talk feature.  Our son\'s bedroom is downstairs so it is nice to be able to talk to my husband or our son from upstairs.  I read reviews that said they didn\'t like the placement of the volume and that the unit was to bright.  The volume control is in the menu setting, but we haven\'t had problems because it stays at the same volume almost all the time.  As far as the unit being bright I would agree, but you have to remember it is a video monitor.  It does have a brightness feature and the video portion can be turned off.  This is a great monitor and I would highly recommend it over other brands!",5
"4451","Stork Craft Tuscany Glider and Ottoman, Cherry/Beige","We bought this glider for our daughter\'s nursery. For the money it\'s great. Love the look of it. Took my husband maybe 10 mins to put it together, mostly just putting the cushions on. He couldn\'t get the one arm snap on that is under the seat custon but you can\'t even tell. He said he could if he uses a hammer. The color of the wood matches our other expresso accents in her room. The cushions, which are kind of like microswead, matches the beige we have in her room. When I first sat on it I thought the seat might be a little too firm but it is actually really comfortable. The back of the chair is very comfortable and I can put my head back with it being supported just right. The arms are high enough for me to able to have support while nursing my daughter. The only thing additional you will have to purchase is a can of WD-40. After the first night the chair started sqeeking, loudly. But you just need to flip it over and put the WD-40 on the hinges and it takes the sqeek away. It glides pretty smoothly too.",NA

Then, when you put the baby in, you have to readjust again for the baby.  If you have to do this while the baby is fussing or crying you will be going out of your mind.

The stroller seems sturdy and moves very nimble and easy to work with, There are some things that the instructions do not explain. There is no adjustment &#34;up and forward&#34; on the front seat. Also, the back toddler seat can be removed if not used, but you have to look for it. By removing it, it will give better access to the bottom storage bin so that you don\'t have to lift up and bother the toddler in the front seat. That all being said we really love this thing.

I searched around all the reviews for the best bibs, and consensus seems to be around Bumkins, the Ikea bibs, and Kushies.  I ordered Bumkins and Kushies, and like Kushies the best for the following reasons:1.  Kushies has more precise sizes.  Bumkins\' smallest is for 6-24 months, so is much larger than this infant size.  The Kushies infant size looks to be right for a child from 6-12 months.2.  Kushies made in Canada; Bumkins made in China3.  The Kushies material looks less plastic.  It\'s still plastic, of course, but it\'s softer and more matte.They both have great prints.Some people really like the Bumkins elastic wrists.  They don\'t seem that substantial or that stretchy to me - definitely not something that would make me purchase the Bumkins over the Kushies after seeing them both.",5

This pump puts shame to the Lansinoh. I am a working mother who needs to pump multiple times during the day...When I say multiple I mean 6-8 times daily. I am also a social worker who spends the majority of my time running around, so I don\'t have time to sit and play with a pump.This pump is quiet. So quiet that I can make business phone calls while pumping. It is efficient, when using the Lansinoh I pumped about 2oz per session and was leaking all over the place all day. With this pump I tend to get 5-6oz per session. The suction is better...It has the same level of suction; however it is not as rough on your breasts. It\'s convenient, you can use the battery pack and clip it to your pants to walk around and do as you please. I can easily move it from the bag it came with into my own bag. It is nicely made. When comparing this to other pumps you can tell the difference in quality. My husband even commented on how nice this pump looked in comparison to my other pump.The only suggestions I have would to go and get a bustier for pumping. The hands free apparatus just looked like pain to me. The other con is the price. Bottom line though it has been well worth the price.  I wish I bought this one first and not waste $150.

I purchased this and it came very quickly (Amazon Prime).  My baby sleeps fine now, no indentation. It is thicker than the thin pads most bassinets come with.  It is a bout an inch and a half shorter than the bassinet, but that is fine with me. Much better than the original bassinet pad. This is one of the best baby purchases I\'ve made; a little pricey but totally worth it.[...]",5

Oballs are firm but also squish under pressure and are really easy for little fingers to grasp. Baby likes blue ball better than dollar store balls because it\'s slightly deflated and easy to pick up and hold. A mini beach ball would serve the same purpose. A slightly deflated mini Pilates ball is really fun big ball for baby. These Might be good for tummy time but we got them after that phase. Good colors and concept.",3

The second I gave it to him he started jabbering at it and trying to get the whole thing in his mouth.  The crinkly wings make great noise and the colors are very vibrant.  The reason I ordered this instead of another similar toy is because of the rings that hang from the bottom.  At 3 months old his coordination is really starting to develop and it is easy for him to get and keep a hold of the rings.  I would highly recommend this toy!",5

However, last spring we had to leave our home for over a month, and we took this with us as regular bed for her.

I particularly liked that it used crib sheets, so we were able to use her normal sheets. Kids like familiarity and routine! We\'ve also traveled by car and air with this bed, and it\'s a great bed to have whether at a hotel or at someone\'s house.",5

"4514","Babyletto Play Blanket, Tranquil Woods","I know you\'re not supposed to use blankets these days (everyone is afraid of SIDS) but I use this as a blanket inside the crib for my 5 month old. She still enjoys being swaddled tightly in her muslin swaddle wraps. I lay her on her back with head in a donut pillow so it doesn\'t get flat. She can\'t really move or roll around yet so I feel safe using this blanket for now. I rather use a blanket than crank up the heater because it gets so dry and uncomfortable for everyone. The cotton soften up with the initial wash as it was hard and crinkly as poplin is when new. The outside is cotton. The print is delicate and gender neutral. So is the pale green color. The inside is poly fill. Overall it\'s a pretty light blanket. Perfect for southern Californian winters...it has been mid 70\'s in the day time here in December/January. Baby probably has to sleep naked in the summer.Why only 3 stars? Well, I just don\'t know why this blanket is $60 for something so small and normal in looks, quality, construction. It\'s beautifully packaged and comes in a clear zippered plastic bag. A nice gift? Maybe. As a mom, I would buy other mom\'s to be presents that are more useful and practical.",NA

"4533","NUK Hello Kitty Silicone Spout Learner Cup, 5 Ounce","I was excited to receive this item for my daughter, because it seemed it would be a great transition from bottle to a more traditional sippy cup.  I also liked the detachable handles and lid, as these would both be great for on-the-go use.However, we had a somewhat frightening experience the first time we used the product, and have since returned it.  After my daughter had been drinking from the cup for a little while, she smiled at me and I noticed a large red chunk of something on her lips, and another in her mouth.  I immediately wiped off/fished out the stuff, and discovered that it was pieces of the soft rubbery coating from the lid!  Apparently she had been chewing on the lid and the coating came right off, in little chunky flakes.  I\'m sure it\'s unlikely that a single piece would come off large enough to be a true choking hazard, but it\'s possible.  And choking hazard or not, I certainly don\'t want to worry about my daughter ingesting this rubber stuff.If your child isn\'t prone to chewing on things, maybe this cup is fine; it definitely has some great reviews from other parents.  But for my teething daughter, it\'s not worth the risk.I\'ll try to upload some photos so show the damage.  By the way, Amazon was great in accepting our return (they always are).",2
"4534","Fisher-Price Precious Planet Sky Blue High Chair","I scoured the reviews and literally researched every high chair on the market.  I have a hand me down Chicco Polly that has been wonderful, but I needed another high chair for our second child.  I believe that you get what you pay for.  This is a very inexpensive, practical high chair.  I think it would work fine for grandmas house, but it just doesn\'t cut it for day in and day out use.  The frame rocked back and forth a little.  The cover has very very little padding.  The recline feature felt very flimsy to me.  My 7 month old really did like the toy, which I thought was super cute too.  I debated boxing it up and sending it back, but I didn\'t want to deal with the hassle.  Ultimately, I pictured my 2 year old trying to get out of it or try to climb up into it and that did it for me.  I decided I would rather spend a little more to have a higher quality item.  I was very impressed with Amazon\'s quick and efficient return process.  Ultimately, I purchased the Graco Blossom 4 in 1 and I could not be happier! My husband\'s exact words were &#34;even I could sit in this thing it\'s so sturdy&#34;.",3
"4535","Baby Trend Double Snap N Go Stroller Frame, Black","I bought a Bob Revolution Duallie stroller with the car seat adapter, not knowing that it only would hold one car seat - and I\'m having twins!  After much searching, I found this inexpensive stroller that would hold 2 car seats and not take up a ton of room in my vehicle (or stores, pediatricians office, etc..).  I was a bit skeptical after reading some reviews because I have Grace snugride carseats - but it is a wonderful product.  I put it together in no time at all and adjusted the bars for the perfect fit with my Grace car seats!  My twins aren\'t here yet, but I know this will get a lot of use while they are in their car seats!  It is easy to maneuver and fold and unfold.  The basket seems roomy enough and the parent tray is the bomb!  It is true you will only use it while they are in their car seats, but at $89 (WalMart) - my sanity and ease of movement is worth every penny!  Good luck - if you are having twins, this is a must!",5

The gate is just left up and I climb over it when I need to get past it.",1

The stitching is crooked. The seams are not sewn well and are buldging. The comforter is small and wont fit a standard crib, only measuring 35X43. Wont be able to use it in the toddler years. I ordered 2 sets because we are expecting twins, and they only sent one set. Waiting to hear back on where the other set is. The colors are pretty. The design is exactly as advertised. All the peices came. Just annoyed that I had to get the scissors out to go behind them to clean it up. May even have to get out the thread and a needle eventually.

"4545","Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali","This works great -- it\'s basically a very large apron that covers baby, with a piece of boning at the top to hold it away so you can see baby.  It has a little corner of terry cloth that is also a pocket, but I can\'t say I\'ve really been using that part.  The only concern I have is the fabric is a bit heavy, since it\'s a double layer, it will probably be too warm in the summer.  I might cut away one of the layers to make it more lightweight for the summer.  The feature to hold it away so you can see the baby is just right, it also lets in some air for baby which is nice.  It rolls up very compactly so I can fit it in my diaper bag.  I tried using just blankets to cover myself, but couldn\'t keep them on or positioned properly.  This makes it easy, which lets me breastfeed in public or when we have company at the house without having to sequester myself.  Really like it!",4

You can really hear the smallest noise, even a clock ticking in a different room than the transmitter!I also bought this unit because both the transmitter and receiver can be AC powered or battery powered, so it\'s versatile as to where you can use it.The only downside is if you try to sleep with this on, the audio tends to get buzzy sometimes, some sort of interference.  Moving or reorienting the receiver seems to help, but it\'s a pain to have to fiddle with it.  Seems like with some digital signal processing or digital tuning that could be eliminated, but then again this is not an expensive unit so I don\'t expect miracles.",4

My kushies, which are a tad big for my 3month old, hold more in them than these, and I have had no issues with any of my other diapers, only this brand.

My older daughter had acid reflux and we had a terrible time getting her to sleep lying in her back. She eventually slept in her bouncy chair in her crib. When my second was born I was psyched to see this. We used in for about 4 months (I was nervous to have 2 babies in one room incase of them waking each other up). She slept in a swaddle which seemed to keep her head from resting too much on the item itself. Maybe that is why we had no problem.

"4552","Beco Baby Carrier Gemini - Carnival","We almost exclusively ""wear"" our little one and were fortunate to receive (or borrow) several different new and used carriers - the Beco Gemini, Maya Wrap, Ergo, Bjorn, and Moby Wrap.  Our daughter is a snuggler, so she is very happy being carried, and we have been doing so since she was a week old, just barely six pounds.The Beco is our favorite because it is very comfortable and looks great, and because it can be used in a variety of positions, doesn\'t require any additional accessories or inserts, and is suitable up to 35lbs. I\'m 5\'2, husband is 6\', and it easily adjusts for either of us to use. Like the Ergo, a waist belt supports most of the weight, which helps save your back. Our daughter loves it so much, I\'ll stick her in it when she\'s inconsolably fussy at home, go about whatever I need to do, and she\'s knocked out within minutes.  The only drawbacks are no pocket for my phone (I end up tucking it under her butt) and the fact that it can get pretty sweaty for both of us after a long walk. Highly recommend this carrier.Oh, and I LOVE this pattern.  I almost exclusively stuck to black and very neutral, non-baby patterns in everything we bought, but I let loose on this one.  My husband would probably prefer a solid color, but finds the carrier comfortable enough that he\'ll wear this despite the whimsical pattern.  Very fun, bright colors.",5

I love that the crib is completely enclosed but has a fantastic amount of ventilation. the best use for this however has been on our boat of all things-a safe place (with life jacket of course) for baby to sit or nap in the shade. we forgot to grab the stakes out of the ground somewhere but it works just fine without, we can always get a replacement set, but haven\'t.  the quality is outstanding.  i recommend.",5

It\'s just so cute, so soft, and it\'s useful (especially if you have hard floors.) I didn\'t utilize it while my kids were newborns, because we have dogs who also loved to lay on it! Speaking of dogs, it has the wonderful feature of being machine washable (but lay it flat to air dry!) It has stayed as soft as ever, two years later. I love it so much that I have bought several more in different designs for baby shower gifts, and the moms have all had nothing but rave reviews regarding their Bestever mats.",5

Additionally, the latch did not close completely, I guess it was broken. I suppose that\'s what you get for $30.  It might be ok if you install it permanently but I would probably spend a little more to get something higher quality.",2

"4579","BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red","I have a 2 year old daughter who uses this potty chair.  We have no problems with it.  The only down side to this type of potty chair is that there is not a removable container to clean out and instead you have to clean out the entire potty chair which can be cumbersome in most sinks.  I decided to leave it in our car so if my daughter does have to use it, it will be there for us.  She hardly ever needs to go potty while we are going places so I use it as a sort of back-up just in case.

I\'m not sure if the company is just trying to make a cheaper finished product or not, but this Woombie has a velcro attachment at the neck (instead of a snap) that comes undone, the zipper doesn\'t work as smoothly, and all of the lettering/branding came off after two or three washes.Another thing I was unhappy with was the amount of ""stretch"" in the neck.  Our baby is ""fingers to the mouth"" crazy, and the older Woombies prevented her from getting her hands up to her face.  The neck of this model is very stretchy, and it does not take a lot of effort on her part to get her hands to her face.All in all, I would still recommend this product, but would implore the company to stick with their original product.

"4585","Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision","I purchased this monitor in November 2012, just before having my 3rd baby.  We have always used audio only monitors for our other  children, but with one of them still being young enough that I wanted to keep an ear on her too once our new baby arrived, we found ourselves looking into a 2nd system for the new baby.  I didn\'t want to invest a lot of money since this was going to be our last child but I knew I wanted to have the convenience of video monitoring.  I chose the Infant Optics DXR-5 after reading reviews on TONS of different brands and models of baby monitors.  The reviews for the DXR-5 were overall very positive and it just seemed like a great value for the price.The monitor, as others have stated, has a very clear display and seems well built and sturdy. The functions (volume/brightness) were easy to adjust. And overall the unit was very user friendly.  The camera unit is also very easy to adjust and maneuver to obtain the perfect view of the area you need to &#34;watch&#34;.  Overall I was very pleased with my purchase.About a week ago, my monitor started having difficulty maintaining a signal with the camera unit.  I contact customer support at Infant Optics and explained what was happening.  I received a very prompt response from Mae, a representative from the company. She outlined in very clear detail the steps I should try in order to see if it would resolve the issue.  Unfortunately, it did not fix the problem.  I contacted her a second time and let her know I was still having problems. Again, her response was very prompt, and she told me that since it was still under warranty to go ahead and send it back to the company and they would issue a new one to replace it.Here I am a week later and everything is up and running perfectly!  I actually think the image is clearer in the new unit I just received.  They must have improved the optics on them!  Overall, I am very pleased with the product but even more pleased with their company\'s customer service!  I can\'t even say enough how impressed I was with the excellence and professionalism of the representative I dealt with. It is something that is VERY rare these days!  I would, without hesitation, recommend this company and product.",4

It still hasn\'t arrived and now I\'ve given up hope.I\'m 6\'3"" and roughly 210 lbs and the rocker is a bit of a tight fit.  Also when I\'m sitting in it the ball bearings squeak.

Due to our work schedules, we need two car seats for my husband\'s and my cars.  I chose to get the Recaro first because of the additional safety features, and I wanted to see if it fit in both cars.  I knew it would fit into my husband\'s four door 2009 Chevy Silverado truck, and it did.  It is a wonderful car seat for his truck, and we can actually fit two adults sitting on either side with a center rear-facing installation.  I love everything about it.Unfortunately, we did not have as much luck fitting it into my 2007 four door Honda Civic.  While it fit perfectly into my car, it turned out to be too tall with a proper center rear-facing installation.  For one, it was easy to bump the baby\'s head on the ceiling of the car.  More importantly, it partially obstructed my view in my rear view mirror.  (I am 5\'7"" and my husband is 6\'2"", and both of us had the same problem). While I could \'mostly\' see out of my rear window with the car seat, I do not find any obstruction an option with my baby in the car.

I am very happy!  I just hung it from the hook I already had in the ceiling for the other organizer and about 2 minutes later I had all 20 hooks occupied, with room for more!The only thing I may do to make it a little more user-friendly is pinch down the hooks around the chain links a bit more with some pliers.

This is the kind of toy that if your kid really takes to it, you will love it. It is easy to transport and wash and fits easily in a baby\'s hand. But, if they could care less, it just becomes another cute toy that serves no purpose. I would recommend trying to find this in person to see if it is a toy your baby responds to; there are several cute characters to choose from.

I bought some absorbent bibs from Carters and while I love them and they are very absorbent, the necks are HUGE.  Even at three months and fourteen beefy pounds they are like a hula hoop around my baby\'s neck!  I do have to say, though, I agree with the reviewer that said the velcro isn\'t the best on these bibs.  I have noticed after three months of daily usage that the velcro is getting kind of junky and not ""sticking"" as well.  I don\'t care, though, I will use a safety pin closure if I have to to increase the life of these bibs.

"4618","Britax Boulevard 70 CS Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Waverly","after doing all the research, i decided on this car seat.  i know, there is SO much overwhelming research!  here\'s my 2 cents on the issues other people had...1.  people said it was too big.  i honestly have much more room in my back seat with this installed than i did with my chicco infant seat.  i know chiccos aren\'t small, but my passenger seat has so much more leg room now2.  people said their kid couldn\'t see around the head wings.  seriously guys?  my little peanut can see just great!  she loves her seat.  it did take a day or two to get used to it.  she was a little whiney at first.  but i was gonna stick it out because you can\'t beat this seat in safety ratings.  she adjusted fine and now loves it.3.  people said the straps were complicated and hard to use.  i haven\'t seen it at all.  the little velcro tabs holding the straps open aren\'t perfect, but they are better than anything else out there.i can\'t remember the rest... but those were the ones that made me hesitant.  i seriously LOVE this seat!  the CS system isn\'t necessary if you know what you\'re doing with car seats, but it is definitely a bonus for my husband who always left the straps too loose ""for comfort.""  the color is gorgeous.  the installation was simple.  couldn\'t recommend this car seat more.good luck!",5

"4622","Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea","This is a GREAT overall cup.  Some points of interest:- This cup may keep drinks colder ""twice as long as regular cups"" as it claims but PLEASE DO NOT TRUST THAT IT WILL KEEP PERISHIBLE ITEMS COLD (OR HOT) FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME such as a Thermos type of insulated vessel.  I have a Thermos type of vessel with a flip cap that I use for keeping ice water cold throughout the day - I can leave ice water in it all day or all night and there is still ice in it 12 hours later.  In the hopes that I could send milk with my preschooler in these cups (which we have been using for three years), I did an experiment.  At 5 pm I put 4 ice cubes and cold water from the refrigerator filter in the cup.  I stirred it around with an accurate digital thermometer until the ice was almost melted and the temperature read 39.2 degrees f.  At 10:14 pm I opened the cup and again took the temperature of the water - and it was 70.7 degrees f, in a room that was air conditioned to 70 degrees.  That\'s right - ROOM TEMP IN 5 HOURS!!  Just so you know, it may be insulated but it is not serious insulation.  Like I said, we have used these cups for 3 years, and I always thought they kept drinks cooler than non-insulated cups but never really paid attention to how long they stayed cold.  Knowing that I wouldn\'t be there to check my child\'s milk and if it was kept cold, I just had to know for sure HOW well it worked and if my child could sip from it all day long.  Because of the results of this experiment, I send water in his cup instead of milk.- Do not overtighten.  When I tighten the lid so that the arrow is on the tighter end of the ""closing range"" delineated area, it is difficult to open.  I use a clean square of that non-skid flexible rubber grid that you can put under rugs so they don\'t slip when you walk on them.  It works better than any other commercial made rubber type of jar opener, at least out of the ones I have tried.  I usually tighten the lid just so the arrow is almost to/just at the looser end of the ""closing range"" delineated area.- Make the holes in the rubber stoppers bigger.  I take a razor sharp knife and make the ""minus"" sign shaped slits into ""plus"" signs.  This allows for more flow and easier drinking.  This also can allow slight leaking, just so you know, but usually only a few drops (if at all).  Just do it a little and then test it - actually drink from the cup to see how easy or difficult it is to get liquid out and adjust accordingly.  I personally test drive ALL my kids\' cups first - you would be surprised how difficult it is to get any liquid from many kids cups!- I have read other reviewers say they take the rubber stopper out when their child is at the table, etc. so they can drink more quickly.  I have found this also to be true and it works great in that capacity.- Beat the heck out of them.  These things are virtually indestructible!- There is no plastic smell that I have noticed from the six or so that we have purchased in the past 3 years.  I like that.  I also like the design and the colors, and they don\'t have dumb pictures or monkeys on them or any of the otherwise ridiculous crap that manufacturers plaster all over baby products.  They are simple, attractive and functional.",4

Nonetheless, my mechanical engineer sister and I had previously looked at several traveling cribs available on the market and found them to be quite difficult to manage to set up/tear them down.  With my husband being gone at least one weekend a month (Army), I need something that I can set up and tear down on my own (and possibly half asleep!).  She generously got me the Lotus Traveling Crib after seeing it on my registry (my cousin recommended it to me) and was I surprised!  It takes a hot minute to take it from the bag to being set up.

"4647","Graco Secure Coverage Digital Baby Monitor with 2 Parent Units","I\'m sure the model numbers have changed, but this looks identical to the one we bought through Amazon about 4 years ago. For the last two years it has transmitted from a shed-row barn about 225\' from our block house. Throughout the night, we hear every snuffle and glug-glug as clearly as if we were in the barn ourselves. Although the transmitter is protected from the rain and snow, it is subject to the same oppressive humidity levels as anything else above the wet low-end of the property just behind it. The horses require that no climate-control devices be used, so the base unit transmits continuously from an unheated/uncooled barn through temperatures ranging from 15 to 100 degrees. In the summer, an air-circulator drowns out most other sounds, but we can still hear the most important ones. The unit beeps a warning when a power flicker requires that it be reset (unplugged and replugged).",5

I assured him it was the best $50 he has ever spent.  Now, I only sleep with the Snoogle and one other pillow in the open part of the Snoogle.  It is, indeed, huge, so it\'s a good thing we have a king sized bed.  However, now that I\'m at 33 weeks, I can\'t imagine sleeping without it.

The only reason I left it at 4 stars is because I haven\'t been able to put it to use much yet. I ordered this because the reviews raved about how helpful it is for infants who suffer from acid reflux/Gerd, which my son has a severe case of. Most nights he has to sleep in his swing or on my chest to keep him propped just right, the rare nights I can get him to sleep in his crib he ends up coughing and choking in his sleep and wakes up within an hour whining and fussing. He\'s been in this lounger for over an hour now and I haven\'t heard a peep out of him, he\'s sleeping so restfully! I had my doubts about letting him sleep in this tonight (I\'m worried if he turns his head he\'ll block his airways) even though it\'s said not to, parents suggest it to help everyone sleep better. Well his head is so supported that he hasn\'t even turned it to the side and while he was awake he couldn\'t turn it enough to get it shoved into the pillow because it cradles his head just right. I\'m so impressed! I have a feeling this is going to get me more sleep (I\'m averaging 4 hours a night and my son is 9 weeks old, needless to say I\'m a zombie most days) and he\'s going to start sleeping deeper, longer, and better than ever!",NA

The design is so timeless and I\'ve seen it on so many design blogs there was no shopping around (plus the price was amazing). I had my husband assemble it this weekend and when he was finished he pushed the mattress down and the wooden pegs that hold the crib sides together  broke.

"4693","DaVinci Futura Cradle in Cherry","our baby is not born at the time of this review, however everything went together really well. for the most part.here are my view points1. my 8 month pregnant wife put this together on her own, (i was at work and she was bored) with no problem.2. everything fit just right, she said that she had to pull it back apart a couple times, she didnt realized a piece was on backwards till 3 steps later. otherwise good.3. this item is about as sturdy as any item of this kind and cost. we have a similar built changing table, if you put your weight on it it might go through the flooring of it. but a baby is of no concern to it.4. the only bad in the construction of the cradle was the wheels. they are good wheels. smooth easy to roll etc.. but they are covered in plastic at the top. this plastic top is what wedges them into the wood of the cradle.either the wheels were a size to small, or the wood was drilled to big. either way they fell out if you picked up the cradle.so i just wrapped a few (2-3) layers of masking tape on the top of the plastic and problem solved.over all im very happy, i only gave it a 4 because i was unimpressed with the shotty drill holes for the wheels.EDIT: our baby is 2 months old. and still in this cradle. very sturdy and it is holding up very well. HOWEVER since the legs are held together by one long piece of wood, and then the cradle, it sometimes ""tweaks"" when you try to roll the cradle. this causes you to walk to the other side to move it some more. i believe it is meant to be pushed long ways not sideways. especially on carpet.another note is that 2 wheels have locks built in, unless you have an angled wood floor or a ton of kids that like to push things this is unnecessary. and the wheels sometimes lock randomly. i dont know if the wheels moving lock them, or if we bump them with our feet. needless to say its a nuisance.i still rate it a 4.",4

"4699","Eddie Bauer Infant Car Seat tan","overall this is a very attractive seat. my hubbie and i chose it because of the suede appearance. my 2 month old fits very comfortably and i especially appreciate the harness,which does not need to go over his head,and the canopy which pulls down quite far and has a vinyl window so he doesnt feel like hes in a cave. however, the seat weighs a ton and is about 25% larger than most seats. i wind up using it sans the base because its very akward lifting it high enough into the back seat of an suv to snap it in. i have to climb in every time to use the lap belt to secure it. alternately, it wont fit into our volvo sedan without the base to lift it some 5-6 inches off of the seat. for the price, id definitely buy this seat again.",4
"4700","Scandinavian Child Anka Convertible High Chair in Honey","Pros:  A nice quality piece of furniture - the wood, finish and construction all appear to be superior to our old wooden high chair.  Our daughter finds it very comfortable as the seat is well designed.  It has the best chair pad I\'ve seen, it wears and washes well, and so nice to know it does not contain harmful materials like other chair\'s pads- no vinyl,pthalates, etc.  Tray is adequately sized for a toddler and easy to clean and remove once you get the hang of it.  It is nice that the tray cover is one-piece construction unlike our old high chair which had parts on the underside that were a pain to clean.Cons: The tray setup is problematic since the tray positions are very limited by the design of the tray- still, we easily solved this problem by removing the front underside tray bracket so we could push the tray in more so that food wouldn\'t end up on our baby\'s lap. Only other con is that while the nice felt pads on the chair base are great for protecting floors and for easily sliding the chair, they are not so easy to keep clean if they get wet from baby spilling food/drink.",4

"4718","Itzy Ritzy Lunch Happened Bento Lunch Box, Rock Star","Aside from the very difficult latch that other reviewers mentioned, this box has a serious design flaw. It\'s one you might not think of unless you actually watch your kid use it. If the weight of whatever you put in the top compartment (a peanut butter sandwich for instance) is equal to or greater than the weight of the contents of the bottom compartment (let\'s say goldfish crackers, blueberries and carrot sticks) and your kid happens to be the kind to eat their snack first at lunch, then when they flip open this box to the bottom tier (assuming they can even unlatch it) the weight of the top compartment flips the box over, sending aforementioned snack items flying through the air and all over the table & your child\'s lunch mates. Design fail. This box is super cute, and the perfect size, and the snack catapult issue may not be a problem for older, more co-ordinated kids, but if you were planning to send this to kindergarten/preschool with your kid, look elsewhere.",2

"4722","Evenflo Secure Step Top of Stair Gate - Taupe","The EvenFlo Secure Step is a sturdily built, heavy gate specifically designed for stairs, though it can be mounted other areas. I was able to mount it easily into studs at the staircase top. Even after moving, it mounted again quickly and easily in the new house. It is a little difficult to adjust width, and sometimes wiggles a bit, requiring retightening. The MAJOR design flaw is the plastic tab that hooks into the bottom of the gate to stop the gate from swinging both ways. It relies on a plastic bump to sit in a hole to be ""secure"". My 2 year old ran into the gate full speed and went right through it and down the stairs; the plastic tab takes very little pressure to move out of its setting. Luckily he was only bruised. I immediately went out and bought a 2"" #6 screw and nut, drilled a hole through the plastic piece and threaded the screw through the tab and hole in the gate to properly secure it to the gate. Another issue: the gate doesn\'t have built-in way to latch out of the way when open; I had to buy a cabinet magnet myself for this. EvenFlo could\'ve spent $1 more to fix both of these issues themselves. Another minor quibble: a metal gate isn\'t very forgiving for a little one to run or fall into (though there are no sharp edges). I wouldn\'t buy this gate again for these reasons, especially given EvenFlo\'s apparent willingness to sacrifice safety to save pennies. We\'ve had better luck since this purchase with soft retractable gates; tougher to mount but superior in all other respects.",2
"4723","Lifefactory Sippy Caps for 9-Ounce Glass Beverage Bottles, Set of 2, Raspberry and Royal Purple","Our 3-year-old and 17-month-old use these bottles for milk with the sippy caps.  The silicone insert is a bit tricky to get to work, but once we figured it out, we\'ve had no trouble.  You can\'t screw the cap on super tight but not too loose either.  Just one twist works for us and we don\'t have any problem with them leaking.  If it gets tight, our 17-mo-old will just say ""tight"" and we\'ll let some pressure out by unscrewing the cap and then screwing it back on.  It doesn\'t happen often though.  We even let him have his bottle in his crib with him throughout the night with no issues of leaking.  The more the cap is used with the silicone insert, the less issue you will have with it being to tight.  Additionally, these get thrown around all the time, on ceramic tile floors before we moved to a new house.  The bottles have never broken, but we have had a cap break and the company sent us a replacement with no questions asked.  Hope these tips help out those who are having trouble.",4

All the people/animals were able to stand up on their own with alittle fluffing of their bases, with exception of the cow who keeps tipping over. But that is fine! It is a great set and I\'m really glad I bought it rather than the plastic toy set. I also love how compact it is...barely took up any room in the Christmas decor box!! One note of improvement for the seller: it would be nice if it came directions of putting the stable together. I am really terrible at that kind of stuff and I could not for the life of me figure out exactly how it was supposed to stick together. I made it work, but I have no idea if I did it the right way!

While I wouldn\'t drive this way, he did have his little milk carton on the tray while we ate in a parking lot.

I can\'t get the strap that positions the belt lower over her shoulder to work as they illustrate in the instructions, it sort of comes more to the front instead of going up her back/shoulder.

"4733","Sugar Booger &quot;Numbers&quot; Diaper Changing Set","Let me start by saying that this changing set is adorable. I have the ""Numbers"" set and everything about it is cute. The quality is really the issue. The changing set was still in a plastic package when I received it. Even thought it was still in plastic, I noticed some little dirt stains on the ""diapers"" canvas zipper bag. I let it go and figured I\'d try to wash it later. The first time I opened the ""diapers"" zipper bag, the zipper broke! I\'ve read about Suger Booger\'s zippers breaking but usually on their little plastic wipes bags--not on a metal zipper! I was shocked how cheaply made it was. Putting these serious issues aside, I dislike the length of the changing mat as well. Even if the baby\'s head is on the mesh it\'s still way too short. I\'ll have to bring a seperate changing pad with it which kind of defeats the purpose. I also have the Munchkin portable changing set and I have to say--it is much higher quality. This one wins in cuteness but if you can\'t actually use it--does it really matter how cute it is? It isn\'t much more compact than the Munchkin either. Again, it\'s sooo cute but not worth it. I wanted to love it--I just can\'t. It\'s too poorly made to even like. Sugar Booger needs to work on quality. They have the ""adorable"" factor down but really, who wants something that falls apart on the first use? Not me!",2

"4743","phil &amp; teds Classic Stroller with Double Kit - Black","Over all, I have had a great experience with this stroller.  I have two babies 12 months apart.  I have the carseat attachment and the second child attachment.  I go running every day with my 20 month old in the back second child seat, and my 8 month old in his carseat in the front attached with the bungee cord bobbles... (not sure what Phil & Ted\'s calls them).  My 20 month old girl gets enough shade by being in the backseat, and I have a carseat canopy to protect my son in the front.  Once in a while when my 20 month old falls asleep in the car, and the 8 month old is awake, I put him in the second child seat, up on the front attachment, and lay the front seat down flat for my 20 month old.  She is extra tall but fits nicely underneath him.  I have never seen another design so convenient to use.I have had common problems you might experience with any jogger type stroller, which has to do with the wheels going flat.  I called Phil & Ted\'s and in my customer-is-right attitude informed them I was well out of warranty, but that I thought the wheels had a faulty design, and wanted a replacement.  They were 100% kind and sincerely apologized, promptly sending me TWO more sets of tires.  Since then, after talking to my friends with many different types and brands of joggers, I learned that flat tires is a common problem in any jogger that have bike-type tires, and they need the same type of repair/maintenance as bike tires.  Phil & Ted\'s customer service could have been defensive and rude, but they were only helpful and generous. (Thanks customer service!)In addition to awesome customer service, I have been pleased with the design of the jogger.  It is easy to put together in the morning, and easy to fold up for my errand runs with the kids.  The tires are quiet and soft, making napping easy for my babies.  I like how narrow the jogger is to fit through tight isles in the store.  I prefer it to a shopping cart if I don\'t have too much to buy.After two years, I am still in love with my Phil & Teds.",5

"4747","Graco Prenatal Listener","I\'ve read the negative reviews for this product and the ""Danger"" warnings. I don\'t agree with them at all! Here\'s my 2-cents:I bought this product and saw the warning to ""wash your hands after using"" this device because of it being made from materials that ""may cause cancer or birth defects"".  That is a ""legal"" warning they must put on the box to protect the company. I\'ve seen similar on other plastic products that I\'ve used before quite safely. It sounds WAY more dire than it should, but doesn\'t everything when lawyers get involved? LOL  It does NOT mean that the moment you turn on this glorified stethoscope and place it on your tummy, it\'s going to somehow cause your unborn child to suddenly develop complications. It\'s a LISTENING device, which is no different than a stethoscope or those ear bud sound amplifiers you stick in your ear...within close proxity to your brain. There\'s no ""gamma rays"" or radiation or radio waves being broadcast into your womb. But if you\'re concerned, simply wash your hands and don\'t stick your fingers in your mouth before you do. Seriously, that\'s all you need do.The reality is this device is a very basic, battery-powered stethoscope recommended for use only during 3rd trimester because that\'s when the baby is big enough to make the kind of noise this device can pick up. It does work and is safe, but it\'s not a hospital-grade ultrasound. No gel required, but that means that you shouldn\'t expect what you will hear with this device to be of the same caliber as what you hear while at the OB/Gyn\'s office.I\'m in my third trimester (27th week at the moment) and use this ""prenatal listener"" at home and while at work in an office setting. If the little one is sleeping, I don\'t hear much at all. But if the baby is very active, the pops and thumps are quite clear. Also, on rarer occasions I have heard the faint swoosh-swoosh-swoosh of his heart beat. It\'s rare because I must have the device positioned in just the right spot and the baby has to be turned just right for it to be clear.The thing I like most about this device is that with the two sets of ear buds, it has given my husband and I many chances to bond while listening to the soft sounds (thuds, thumps, and pops) our baby makes. It\'s not quite as beautiful as that moment when you first hear your child cry after delivery, but it\'s still worth treasuring the time together. And, yes, it was also quite funny to watch it bounce on my tummy when our little boy became a practicing gymnast in there! LOLLastly, I only paid $25 for this product, so anything above that (to me) would price gouging.",5

I\'ve used it at restaurants, too. I\'ve used it on wood and granite surfaces. The downsides are (1) the clamp system arm is not wide enough to slide over the tops of some tables, rendering it useless, and (2) I was never able to get the plates or bowls to lay flat on the suction base dish holder. The plates didn\'t come off, but were just wobbly. All in all, the product met my need.",4

"4799","Badger Basket Three Basket Set, Pink","I searched for baskets for my baby\'s changing table for HOURS!!!  (I was on bed rest, so I had the time to kill)  I finally decided to go with these because they seemed so popular.  I was very excited for them to arrive but when I opened the box they smelled pretty strongly of paint - not good for a baby nursery, or for a pregnant woman for that matter!  I wanted to give them a chance though and I figured they\'d air out, so I put them up on the changing table shelves.  They are so tall and deep that it was actually a pain because I have to pull them out to see in them and get the items out.  At first I figured I could live with that even if it was annoying, but the white paint is scratching all over my beautiful cherry wood changing table that I just bought!  So frustrating!!  I\'m returning these baskets.  I found some beautiful soft wicker ones for half off at a local store to replace them.  Thank goodness I\'m off bed rest now so I can shop in store!  Normally I\'m an online shopper, but for baskets I recommend finding something in a physical store.  These might be okay if you have a REALLY tall space to put them in and the shelf you\'re putting them on is already white, because the white paint transposes if you move the basket it on it at all.  Otherwise, you should pass on these.",1

"4801","Thinkbaby Thinkster Straw Bottle, 9 Ounce, Natural/Orange","This is a very nice product - we\'ve had one for about a year, and ordered another one as our daughter (almost 2 years old) has done a number on the straw by chewing it over the year.The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the fact that it will leak from the straw sometimes due to a negative air balance (ie the liquid slowly comes up the straw), but it happens rarely enough that it isn\'t a huge problem.  Also every now and then when filling it up you can\'t get anything out of the straw, but quickly moving it around fixed the problem.This thing is VERY durable - has been dropped a LOT, and it has not affected it at all.  The flip top will come off when dropped, but that\'s actually a GOOD thing, or else it would break off.By far our daughters favorite beverage container.  So much so that we need to get another one after a year because I don\'t think she\'d be happy without it.",4

My son liked them.They are not very great though because of the design. The bottom or stem of the spoon is very heavy so when you keep the spoon in bowl it falls out of the bowl due to the stem weight. The weight also maked it easy to topple out of the bowl even with slightest jerk. My son could splash the food all over the table and sometimes on the floor with slightest movement. My mom and mother in law were so frustrated with these spoons that they wanted me to throw them away. Only thing that kept me from getting rid of these were I bought a pack of 6! Had it been only couple of them I would have replaced them with some light weight spoons immediately.",3

"4816","Evenflo Dash Baby Carrier, Silverado","I love this carrier!  Makes life a whole lot easier with a newborn.  I\'m a heavy-chested plus-sized new mom, so I was a bit skeptical if this would fit like I needed it to, but I saw another review with a mom who was also plus-sized and decided that for the price I would give it a try.  I have to say that it exceeded my expectations.  It\'s comfy for my newborn.  He goes to sleep the minute I put him in it and stays asleep for a long time while mommy is able to get things done around the house!  I can even get in a t.v. show or two!  Amazing stuff!  My newborn is not a big fan of bouncers or his infant pillows, so this has helped a whole lot in keeping baby happy... and when baby\'s happy... mommy\'s happy!My newborn was a preemie and we did a lot of skin to skin, kangaroo care in the hospital, so he likes to be close and be able to hear mommy\'s heartbeat, this carrier allows it.  And because there is no material between you and baby on the inside, skin to skin is still possible if you like.  I tried one of those cloth wraps but was a little scared of how confined baby seemed, because you have to enclose their head in the fabric so that the head is supported... but I had to keep checking to see if he was breathing because like I said, I\'m heavy-chested , so I was afraid a booby would suffocate my baby.  This one eases me alot more because he turns his head to the side to hear my heartbeat and I can see him by just looking down, no more moving fabric over to see his face.This one is good for a preemie sized baby... my son was 5 lbs when he came home... and 18 inches.  He is about 9 lbs now and about 22 inches at 2 months old. He looks like he can maybe go to 4 months with this.... maybe more... I will update as he progresses.  But so far so goodIt\'s comfy on my shoulders and no strain on my back which is a huge plus for me, because when you have more chest in the front, you already tend to have shoulder and back pain, no added pain is welcome.  So this is great!  I highly recommend this... so that\'s why I gave it 5 stars!...it almost got a 4 because I just don\'t know how to work the safety latch on the side... seems like you need a lot of work to get it loose, I was thinking it is there to remove baby easier from the carrier without having to take loose the other straps, but not really sure.  In any case, I still give it 5 stars!",5

"4818","Fisher-Price Potty Training, Learn-to-Flush","As a potty, this device works just fine. I like that the seat cover comes off and can attach to a regular toilet seat for times when my daughter wants to feel like a big girl. The little cup that holds waste is a little small/shallow for bigger messes and so we\'ve just gone ahead and used the seat cover on the regular toilet. The biggest annoyance with this potty though, is that if the power is left on the music and sound effects will turn on at random times, usually late at night. There isn\'t much in the way of volume, so it\'ll be a full blast of singing and water flushing sounds coming from the restroom sometimes at 2am and wakes up my whole family. It\'s a little creepy to hear in the middle of the night, if I\'m honest. So now, I have to just leave the thing off permanently and also cover the switch with tape so my daughter doesn\'t turn it on again.",1

"4821","Graco Alano Flip It Travel System","Another review from someone who hasn\'t actually used this with a baby yet...but I have already purchased it, based on my researching strollers for almost a year via online reviews and in-store experimenting.  There are a lot of great strollers out there that cost big bucks, but I wasn\'t willing to pay $500+ for a stroller.  I love this one because it\'s lightweight and has a slightly-narrower wheel base than most of the other stroller systems I tried out (this stroller weighs 19 lbs, compared to the 28-33 lb ones I was trying out), and is VERY easily maneuvered with one hand.  The color scheme is gender-neutral.  BRU has it for about $30 more in a grey and yellow scheme.  I like the Strata, which is what I purchased.  It\'s very pretty, and the aqua is just slightly brighter than pictured -- not garish at all, and aqua enough to not automatically scream ""baby-boy pastel blue!""My favorite part about this stroller is that the handle swivels so that you can push the baby facing you, or facing outward.  Most the travel systems let the baby face you when they\'re in the snap-on infant carrier, but unless you go really pricey, it\'s hard to find one that lets the kid face you once they\'re out of the infant carrier.  I found one other that did, but you have to move the seat itself, which takes time, effort, and can\'t be done with the child in the stroller.  At one year old (when the baby outgrows the infant carrier), Mom is still the most interesting thing out there for most kids, and I want to be able to interact with my baby as I\'m pushing him, vs. having him isolated from me and staring out at the world.  The handle swivel mechanism is very easy to use, but locks in place with a nice, secure feel.The one and only tradeoff with this stroller (for me) is the lack of a storage tray for drinks, keys, etc.  Because the handle swivels over the stroller body to change the seat from facing inward to outward, they didn\'t put a tray on the handle.  If it were me, I would have designed a reversible tray so that it worked from both directions, but they didn\'t.  What they did do was provide one cup-holder that sits on the handle off to the side, and can swivel with the handle.  For me, that\'s an acceptable trade-off, but it might be a deal-breaker for others.This came with the stroller, carseat/carrier, and the stay-in-car carseat base.  As with most products containing plastic products, this smelled when I first took it out of the box.  I set it outside for a couple days to off-gas, and I\'m going to wash the fabric parts before using...but the smell dissipated very quickly.UPDATE -- My daughter is 15 months now.  We used this stroller a lot for the first 10 months or so, but once she outgrew the infant carrier, I found an umbrella stroller to be easier to lug around for shorter trips.  I still think this stroller was a great buy, and the ability to have my child facing me is GREAT.  If we\'re going to be out all day, I\'ll take this one along.CONS:  Folded up in my super-tiny Mazda 3 trunk, it\'s bulky (as is any stroller -- it\'s not any bigger than any of the other strollers I tried).  So when I want to preserve trunk space, we go with the $20 umbrella stroller.  The seat reclines well, but doesn\'t go completely upright to 90 degrees, which can bug my daughter when she wants to look around.  Finally, when in ""reverse"" mode (child facing mom, not in the infant carrier), it doesn\'t turn on a dime.  I think you\'re only going to get that with the much pricier versions, and for me, it worked perfectly fine (still turns better than my cheapo umbrella stroller).Ultimately I still say this was the best stroller for the money at the time (I haven\'t researched strollers since I got this one), and I\'m still quite happy with my 5-star purchase.",5

"4823","Kanga Care Wet Bag, Crimson","I bought my first Kanga Care wet bag at a hippie cloth diaper store that I visited, and I am so glad I did. Now I\'m back for another one! This bag contains odors wonderfully, and seems to be made of high quality material. I have had my first bag for quite awhile now...almost a year. I have never had any leakage when using it with diapers, although once we used it for sopping wet swimsuits at a hotel and it did leak some water. I am CDing my 5th baby now when we are at home (out and about I use disposables, as well as at night), and we are home quite a bit as we homeschool. I can fit around a week\'s worth of diapers for us in it. I can use it until it is pretty much jam-packed full, and then it\'s about time to wash or I\'ll run out of diapers! I love that I can just throw it in with the diapers--super convenient. I wish I would have bought a second one sooner.My only negative thought on these is that, unlike the Planetwise bags, they don\'t come in many adorable prints. But since I am pretty practical (with 5 kids, who has time for anything else? :)) I didn\'t figure that even merited taking off a star, so I still rate this 5 stars. I would certainly recommend to a friend, and obviously, I would buy again since I am!",5

"4825","Plush Rocking Horse","I put this together quite easily, I thought the handles by the horses ears were sort of crappy.

I am happy with it overall and it is sturdy. My only complaint is the handles by the horses ears.",4
"4826","Keekaroo Height Right High Chair, Infant Insert and Tray Combo, Natural/Cherry","I originally was thinking about getting the Stokke Tripp Trapp, but realized that I wanted a tray and an infant seat (for comfort for my little one) and I didn\'t want to pay tons of extra money.  So glad we went with the Keekaroo.  The chair has held up well over the past 6+ months of feedings, and wipes down quite easily.  Food can get stuck in between the &#34;infant insert&#34; and the wooden seat, so you do have to clean that out regularly, but it\'s easy to do and doesn\'t take long.  The only thing I wish is that it had wheels so that I could easily move it from my kitchen into my dining room, but I think that\'s a pretty minor complaint.",4

"4828","Peg Perego Primo Viaggio Car Seat / Infant Carrier with LATCH Base - Black Sable","I researched this seat quite extensively before buying.  My first choice was the Britax companion, but at the time it was brand new on the market and STILL no one in our area carries it. I wanted something that I could look at.  I do agree that my daughter gets too hot in it.  I love the leveling base.  You can unscrew it, get the seat belt as tight as possible, and then rescrew the base to get an awsome fit for those of us that don\'t have new cars.  The shade takes a learning curve.  All you have to do is push the plastic part toward the seat to unlock it.  It would be nice if it were bigger.  The major reason I went with this seat is that it actually has styrofome in it... like the Britax to absorb an impact.  Almost all the infant seats have nothing to protect the baby in an accident except a seatbelt and a piece of plastic.",4

Attaching the Jumpster is very easy and can be easily detached and put away while not in use.  Initial assembly and adjustments for length are very easy.

"4835","Dream On Me Zodiak Portable Playard, Navy","Wanted a &#34;cheap&#34;, but quality alternative for when grandchildren came to visit. We already have a bells and whistles Graco for our own 16 month old twins, as well as an Arm\'s reach co sleeper, but needed something less expensive and a bit more portable when grandchildren came to visit. I love the simple and clean pattern, that although I would consider it neutral, definitely made husband happy that it had a more masculine feel to it than our other gray neutral pack and plays. The box it was shipped in was quite small compared to the other pack and plays, but when we actually set it up, it did not look much smaller than the standard sized pack and plays. Speaking of set up, I was concerned reading some of the reviews that it would be difficult to do, but I had it up within 15 seconds. Unlike many of the other brands we have used with push buttons, this one has triggers you feel for within the fabric that need to be pulled, in the center of each rail, in order to release them to collapse the play yard. The most difficult part of &#34;take down&#34; was trying to get the mattress velcro straps in reaching distance of the plastic D ring you slide the velcro strap through. The mattress has an extra 3 inch folded portion that I couldn\'t figure out where to put it so that it all closed up nicely. I could not find any videos that showed how to do it on this model #438 so I highly recommend that you pay attention to how the mattress is wrapped around the pack and play before you completely unvelcro it the first time. The mattress itself does not seem to be as full (kind of flimsy and a bit more uneven) as other brands, but you could buy a thicker 3&#34; mattress for this if your child was going to use this for an extended period of time... say for more than a week. We plan on using a thick blanket under the mattress though, as other users have mentioned (why would I buy a $35.00 mattress for a $39.00 pack and play?... as they say-&#34;just sayin!&#34;). Kids can sleep anywhere really so I wouldn\'t let the mattress be a complete deterrent from buying this item.",4

Now we\'ve tried every trick in the book to get it to function properly but to no avail. The monitor will not turn on even when plugged in &, one time when we actually did get it to come on briefly, the screen froze up & there was no sound. Completely unreliable & very cheaply made. Unfortunately we purchased it before our baby was born so by the time we started using it & realized how horrible it is, we are beyond the return period with Amazon so will also be trying to deal with Levana directly now.

"4856","Summer Infant Sure and Secure Double Bedrail, Blue","Read the reviews and as always you have to take many of them with a pinch of salt.  Needless to say we were in the market for a dual-sided rail set for our son.  We had removed a rather expensive queen bed for his nursery a few years ago and now he&#8217;s at the age where a  bigger size bed was needed.Rather spend on a children\'s bed that would require replacing in a few years we decided to give the old bed and mattress a try.  My point here is in the unusual case where these rails might be required to branch the width of a queen size bed, I can attest to the fact they will, the mattress has enough weight and height to keep the uprights in solid formation and prevent him from falling down between mattress and rail  ... for the record he now sleeps soundly for the whole night in the bed, although be it rather large for him.The bed is a low platform bed and solid wood construction, the sides rails are set to their deepest setup, one side is designed to stay in the upright position permanently, the other side (right hand side as seen in the stock photo) folds outward and down, although the platform bed prevents this from being vertically downwards.Assembly is easy and instructions are clear and simplistic in nature, time to assemble without a stop-watch or pushing the sound barrier was approximately 25 minutes.  Construction is good and solid (for cloth sided rails), this is in comparison to a single sided rail used in his cribs side off setup.After reading these reviews, purchasing this item, assembling it and for what is a little over two weeks and backed by a sense of assurance, I&#8217;m left struggling with what some of the reviewers as saying, for example &#8220;useless and unsafe&#8221;, I can see no evidence to support this in my experience and environment.  I don&#8217;t want to sound like I&#8217;m out to defend a product, but I think for the price, construction and (depending on one&#8217;s level of common sense) installation this is a very good product, in my opinion.For what it is and the price,I highly recommend this product, but please do a small amount of research before you buy.",5

"4872","Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","This has been a lifesaver for us especially when we had to sleep train our baby. She wasn\'t sleeping longer than 3 hours at 6 months, and now after a day of training, she slept half way through the night the second day and all through the night the third day. I was as attached to my baby as she was when we were co-sleeping, so having this available to check on her was such a relief to me. It curbed my urge to go in and make sure she was okay.  o far we have had no disturbances in the video.PROS:- This device gives an amazing image quality in total darkness without creating any added light in the room.- The image options are great, you can control the brightness and the sound.- The sound setting can be put pretty high which is great.- The movement of the camera is smooth and has wide area coverage.- It displays temperature of the room the camera is placed in- Signal is strong in a large 3000 sq. foot house double-story.- wire of charger is long- speaker button allows you to speak through the camera into the room, so I was able to give my husband instructions without having to be there- it has a button on the camera itself too to shut it off, so if you accidentally left the monitor screen still \'on\' downstairs, and dont want anyone listening on your phone conversation, you can easily turn it off on the camera without having to go all the way down- it is sleek and not bulky, looks good, and quality is decent.- beeps when battery is getting low- button gives you option of keeping the sound on but video off, and if you tap it again, the video comes back onCONS:- Battery doesn\'t last long without the charger, maybe two hours or less with video on.

"4873","Mobicam DL Digital Monitoring System","Pro:- In our home, the image is sharp and the sound is crystal clear.

(While the side to side titling isn\'t important if the video camera is placed on a counter top or crib-edge, it is a huge factor when mounting the monitor on a wall.  Our old video camera titled up/down, and left/right almost 90 degrees in each direction.  I had it mounted in an inconspicuous place.  Now with this video camera, it had to be mounted such that it lined up with the crib in its direct line of site, and it is an obvious eye-sore.- Complicated menu systemNot yet sure if we will keep it.

It is adorable; however, when we opened it, it was marked ""made in china"" and ""surface clean only"".  If I had know either of these things before purchasing the puppy, I would not have bought it.  If I am buying a stuffed animal for my son, it has to be able to go in the washing machine.  We weren\'t returning it, so I decided to give it the washing machine test anyway, because he wasn\'t going to chew and suck on it without me being able to wash it.  I washed it on delicate cycle in a delicates bag.  It was a failure.  Sadly, it did not wash well.  The stuffing is all out of sorts which is why it is probably ""surface clean only"".

You can tell in recent years it\'s now cheaply made. Now that the brand quality went down I just ordered a new pump called simplisse. It\'s not like your typical pump.

These make preparing my baby meals even faster and more fun! The storage trays keep everything organized and neat. OXO is a company of parents for parents. Great product!",NA
"4894","Baby Care Play Mat - Pingko Friends (Large)","This is a nice large mat for a play area for our baby. We have hard wood floors so the mat adds protection for a baby crawling and learning to walk. The colors and vibrant and pretty. I like how it\'s double sided so we can flip it over for a change of scenery. It\'s educational with all different kinds of animals with their names printed too. The cushion is like a memory foam, so it\'s nice and comfortable. A wonderful product and great investment.",5
"4895","Britax Stroller Organizer, Black","For those just wanting a small pouch for vaulables or keys, along with a cup holder, this is the best. Having a thermal pouch is just gravy. And the best part is that it doesnt get into the way of folding down our B-Agile stroller. Get it!",5
"4896","New!! Maclaren 2012 Twin Techno Stroller in Black","This stroller is great for looks, under storage and shade.  Other than that it\'s extremely frustrating.  It\'s a pain to open.  The seat adjustment requires two hands which, with twins can be a pain in the butt and very inconvenent.  I do like the seat strap clips because they are ""child proof"" but the rest of the stroller I could really do without.  It was a lot of money for not much.  I say save your money and buy a oombi!  I wanted this stroller becuase it was high-end and wanted something nice for my twins. Well, it\'s all, the name and looks, nothing to write home about.  Do not buy unless you just want it for the looks and sun shade.----UPDATEWe have had this stoller a little over a year now.  I regret purchasing it.  You think with the high price tag you are getting quality!  Think again...this thing is stiff and parts are starting to give out on it.  Safe your money and just buy the combi double which I have seen several good reviews on.",1
"4897","C.R. Gibson Keepsake Chest, Jack","I love this keepsake box, it is well made and the design and colors are beautiful.  It is a good size, it holds everything i have wanted to put in it, and i have all my little keepsakes as well as all the professional pictures that i have had taken of my daughter.  I know that this will hold up through time and that my daughter will enjoy it in the years to come!  I definitely recommend this and the other CR Gibson items!",5

I was pleasantly surprised with it\'s size - it\'s more compact then I\'d expected and is about the same height as our kitchen chairs. My son seems comfortable and safe in the infant insert. Adjust the straps before you sit your child in the chair as doing so requires both hands. It\'s so nice to have him join us at the table, and I\'m confident that the chair will grow with him. Cute, sleek, sustainable, easy to clean. I\'m happy with it.",5

"4906","Baby Trend Diaper Champ","Unlike others, the Diaper Champ uses standard trashbags -- saving you headaches from trying to find the right bag and money because you don\'t have to buy a bag that only works in the Champ.  The Champ uses a wonderfully simple design to keep out odors and won\'t break.  The best part is that it is a full-sized can, which means you have to empty it less often.  The one drawback about not smelling dirty diapers is when you go to empty the Champ -- take it outside before you open it!",4
"4907","Melissa &amp; Doug Bella Butterfly Snack Container","This container is great because it is very practical.  I use it for my daughter\'s snacks when we go on outings that are more then an hour.  She loves the butterfly design.  I have also used it for my own lunch at work haha got quite a few compliments on it too.",4
"4908","Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Sea Turtle","I had been doing research on this sea turtle for a while. It would be a gift for my future godchild. I have seen it for as much as $40 plus s/h which would make the final cost about $50. It is nice but I felt that was too much for this item. I found it on Amazon at a very reasonable price. Once I got it, my godchild\'s big sister of 2 confiscated it and it is now in her room until he is big enough to get it back. Wonderful item and I suggest all to buy it. Great addition to a child\'s room.",5
"4909","Pearhead Lil\' Peach Bear Bragbook, Blue","This album holds 30 photos, which is more than most of the other brag books (20 photos) I checked out. The slot on the album cover for your own baby\'s photo is quite brilliant. The 2&#34;x3&#34; wallet photo I stuck in there didn\'t quite fill out the space, so I\'d suggest cutting up your own 2.25&#34; square to best fill it out. This particular book has a page for you to fill out date, place, weight, etc. of your baby so I\'d recommend this book to show off a newborn rather than an older kid.",4
"4910","Summer Infant Swaddleme Pure Love Adjustable Infant Wrap, Alligator","I was excited to get this because to be honest, my fiance\'s a champ at swaddling and for some reason, I suck at it. I tried to get my son in this, he freaked out! I tried with my fiance\'s help and he still freaked out. He was probably 10 lbs at the time, was 11 lbs at his last appointment, and is probably 13 lbs now. Yet, this was still too big for him, even though it says it\'s for 7-14 lb babies.",1

"4915","Cosco Scenera Convertible Car Seat, Moonstone Dot","I bought this carseat as an extra for my mom\'s car when we\'re visiting.  It is a fine carseat.  It\'s very light weight, made in the USA, seems comfortable enough.  When rear-facing it is a little difficult to adjust the straps, but I have found this to be true with every carseat I\'ve owned.  After buying from Amazon, I saw it in Wal-mart for $40.",NA
"4916","Green Sprouts Nail Brush","Even if you cut them regularly, those nails get dirty quickly on a li\'l toddler!  This little brush has bristles just soft enough for our toddler to begin learning to clean his own nails while still stiff enough to do a good job. (He wouldn\'t use a regular brush--the bristles were too stiff for his tender little fingers!)The smooth wooden handle is beautiful and the simple green outline of a whale is cute...and helps to get him to use the brush. Of course, the natural bristles (as opposed to plastic) are a nice addition to your eco-friendly household. Definitely recommend.",5
"4917","Child Airplane Travel Harness - Cares Safety Restraint System - The Only FAA Approved Child Flying Safety Device","This harness worked ok for our 12 month old. There is the top strap that goes around the seat and it does tend to push their little heads forward.It might work better when she is bigger. My chief complaint is that there is no strap between the legs and without something grippy to sit on, she slid out from under the straps several times, which negated the advantages of having her in a harness vs a regular seat belt.",NA
"4918","Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","8 panel was perfect for my 9 months old. When i need to do something i put my daughter in the cage with some toys and she will be playing alone while i do my cooking, chatting or taking shower.  So much relief for me.Don\'t buy 6 panel because it will be very small space for baby\'s to play. I did the right thing by choosing the 8 panel . Very light , folds perfect and i can adjust in a second. Since it is very light it can collapse easily though. Overall everything is ok.",4
"4919","Evenflo Splash Mega Exersaucer","My baby enjoys this product a lot. I started using it with him at 5 months. He is tall for his age though slim and I think he will get a lot of use out of it. If you want stabilizers for the base email evenflo and they will send them for free. That way you can get more use out of it (I personally don\'t like to have my kid wobble around for a long time...when it\'s stable he can just stand and play in it without wobbling). It\'s a good product for a good price and to be honest I am glad it doesn\'t make noise/require batteries/etc.Note: my baby is 7 months and still using it. He continues to enjoy it. We do have it set at the highest height setting now so he won\'t be able to use it *too* much longer but I think it\'s a good value for money and a must-have. We have not had any problems with any parts malfunctioning/posing danger to my son.",5

"4925","Safety 1st Nature Next 3-in-1 Potty","My daughter is 16 months old and we have been starting to try and work on potty training with her before our second baby comes in August. You can\'t beat the price of this potty, but it is hard for her to sit on on her own. She has pretty short legs so when she tries to sit by herself she can\'t get past the pee guard. I do like the fact that you can use it as a stool or take the top off for a seat on the toilet but as a potty chair it doesn\'t work that well for us.",2

"4931","Cosco Summit High Back Booster Car Seat","I bought this booster for my son when he grew out of the rear facing travel system. I looked a literally 50 car seats, read reviews, even consulted consumer report (which gave it the highest safety rating). We have been using it now for almost a year and it is great! The covers on the shoulder straps easily slip off and with the seat cover are very washable (colors are still true - no fading; stains are easy to remove with a little shout or whatever you use). Installing this seat was also very easy; and switching from car to car is also easy. The cup holder on the base pulls out as needed for little hands to reach. Another plus the recline function. Often when my son has fallen asleep on car rides, I can easily reach in the back seat and recline him, which eliminates his head falling forward. There are three settings so we have used them all. My son even tells me that he loves it and how comfy it is as we travel nearly 90 miles to and from work/daycare daily. This construction is sturdy, materials and fabrics are high quality. I bought this model for my siblings with children of various ages - and we are all in agreement - its a great buy and high quality product. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a car seat for a great price.",5

Unfortunately, my son really goes for color, which I realized after I purchased this and he seemed to have little interest in it.  He uses it once in a while, but he\'s definitely not attracted to it. Too bad, because I would prefer he chew on something organic.",3
"4934","Graco Blossom 4-In-1 Seating System, Sapphire","My daughter in law loves this chair.  We got it for them last Christmas when granddaughter was 7 months old We liked the idea of the chair having several ways to use it.  2 kids could use it at a time in certain positions. and there was a seat to take with them when visiting people with out a high chair. Moves very easily, Would buy again.",5

"4936","Fisher-Price Rainforest Monkey Teether","Our son liked other newborn toys/teethers way better.  He played with this occasionally, but seemed to find it more boring.  For the price, I\'d probably suggest still trying it out I guess because I consider it a reasonably priced baby toy.",3
"4937","Goodbyn Bynto Food Container, Red","I got this lunchbox for the kids but my husband is actually using it for his lunches now. He doesn\'t use the water bottle, so the three compartments are perfect to fit for example a lunch dish, a side salad and a snack. The lid however is unfortunately not spill proof like I would have expected for the price. This makes it still great for sandwiches but not for leftovers like pasta with sauce. Otherwise this would have been a five star product.",4

The size of the towel is generous and I love wrapping my little one up in this after a bath.  Also, I love how the muslin washcloth is so soft unlike other cheap products out there.  Although Aden & Anais is on the pricier side, you won\'t be disappointed!",5

"4942","Summer Infant SwaddlePod, Ivory, Newborn","We brought this to the hospital and put our newborn in it right away, rather than swaddling in blankets.  Even the nurses raved about how wonderful it was and my son loved it instantly.  It\'s soft and lightweight, so it\'s comfy and versatile for whatever clothing baby is wearing underneath.  The only drawback is that my son stretched it out, so when we loaned it to my sister, the neck was pretty stretched and easy to escape... so it may not be durable enough to serve as a hand-me-down.  Still a favorite and well worth the money.  Buy more than one, so you can rotate when one goes in the laundry!",5

And more amazing that anyone would buy it.  I thought it was a joke when someone posted it on Facebook.  My comment was, I\'d buy one if it came in grown-up size!  It\'s really sad people use devices like the iPad to babysit and pacify their children.  We have a friend who didn\'t heed our advice and pretty much from birth did this.  The didn\'t even give him edutainment stuff, he was watching anime or whatever he fancied.  Now the kid, at 2 1/2, can hardly speak without yelling - mimicking the characters in the shows.  He can\'t count past 10, can\'t recite his alphabet.  A friend of his (same age) who didn\'t &#34;get to&#34; play with such devices can count to 100 and beyond, can recite the alphabet, read small words, and is learning addition.

It is not a true musical instrument for the budding Neil Peart drummer virtuoso in your family.  It is durable, as both of our under-5 boys not only bang on it, but they also stand on it, sling it around the house, and play on it.

I love the idea that she will be able to use this bed for a long time - don\'t know why anyone would not buy a convertible crib.  You must purchase the side rails seperately; however, the cost is reasonable considering the potential length of use.  Most importantly the baby likes it - she\'s already taking a nap in it.",5

They are soft, flexible and the only ones large enough to wrap all the around the edges of the cloth insert so there is rarely any poop on the cloth diapers at all.The other liners we tried like the kushes roll were just too stiff and seemed to just get bunched up between her legs, letting the sides of the diaper get poop stained. These seem to have a little stickiness to them that gives them better coverage of the cloth insert. This ""stickiness"" also makes it really easy to prepare a bunch of cloth liners (we use the g diaper cloth insert with an additional soaker pad i bought off ebay, a combination which really does the trick for us) so we just have to pop them into the diaper, making diaper changes just about as easy as with disposables.Not sure if they would be as superior with a different type of cloth diaper, but with our system they\'re just awesome!WARNING: DO NOT FLUSH THESE IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER HOUSE WITH CONCRETE, CAST IRON OR CEMENT SEWER LINE. THEY WILL CLOG THE SYSTEM. I would say this of any of the ""flushable"" liners. Really, why put anything into the water waste system that you don\'t have to, because it just has to be removed at the sanitation plant anyway. We just use a regular (diaper dekor) pail for the liners.",5

"4974","The First Years 3 Pack Take &amp; Toss Infant Section Bowls With Lids, colors may vary","I guess you get what you pay for.  These bowls are awful.  Even if you place the lid on carefully, while pressing the 4 ""icons"", the lid still doesn\'t stay on.",1
"4975","Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","Sometimes it\'s not worth going the cheap route and after having this monitor for a week, it further reinforced the idea that cheap products lead to cheap results.  First of all it ate up the 9 volt battery within four days.  Secondly, there was so much static that it drove my husband and I crazy.  Yes, we changed the channel, but it was the same static as before.  If the static doesn\'t bother you then go for it.  Otherwise it\'s not worth the money we saved.",1
"4976","Regalo Extra Wide 58 Inch WideSpan Walk Through Safety Gate, White","Very happy with this gate.  Quality construction feels solid when tightened to the wall.  Comes with three different sized attachments so it took a little time to determine which ones will best fit the opening in our hallway. Seemed flimsy when try to hold all the attachment pieces together, but once tightened to the wall it was very solid.  Comes with cups that you can screw into the wall so that the pads do not slip.  Gate opens nicely but only goes about 10 degrees past 90, so the gate does not lie flat to itself when fully open.  I have little dogs so works great, not sure if a very large dog couldn\'t bump the gate free.Instructions are not great, but its pretty self explanatory.  Overall very happy, worth the price.",5
"4977","Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali","I purchased this after seeing my friends easily nurse their babies in public, while I struggled to keep my blanket covered over my baby. I get complements on it all of the time. The pattern is really pretty & stylish, and it easily slips over my head, providing great coverage while my baby nurses. It rolls up really nicely to fit in my diaper bag. I don\'t leave the house without it!! Great purchase.",5
"4978","Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White","Does the job and makes me feel safe having my daughter in bed. Daughter rolls around and this is perfect.  I would recommend!",5
"4979","Baby Einstein Bendy Ball","I like the sound that this ball makes and it definitely peaks my baby\'s interest when I shake it.  My baby is 3 months old and I shake it for him but I definitely do worry when he gets older if he is going to conk himself in the head and face with this thing because it is so heavy.  I feel much safer giving himRhino Toys Oball Rattlebecause it is lightweight and BPA free.  Maybe this ball will come in handy later when he is crawling and I can roll the ball to motivate him.  I don\'t think I will be letting him play with this thing himself.  If I could return it, I probably would.",3

"4982","Kolcraft Pure Sleep Therapeutic 150 Crib Mattress","The only reason I\'m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because this mattress is pictured with having &#34;vents&#34; on the side for air circulation however mine did not. Not sure why but slightly misleading. Other than that our 2 year old sleeps great on it and we have no other complaints. Still highly recommend",4
"4983","Light Blue Pique Cradle Bumper - Size 18x36","Bought this because of specific size needed for the grandson\'s antique cradle.  Not as thick (amount of foam) as I thought it could of beem.  Otherwise fits the cradle and especially like the ties that are affixed to the item.  Price is higher than the quality warrents.",3

"4987","Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","SO cute - my 8 month old loves ""brushing her teeth"" after meals, and looks just like a baby chimp holding onto her banana.",5
"4988","OXO Tot Feeding Spoon Set, Green","Our kid likes little bites, so these didn\'t work for us.  We like the cheapo gerber metal spoons with the rubber tipped ends.  Even those sometimes have too much food for him.  However, I am holding on to these with the hopes that when he is a self-feeding toddler they might work out better!",NA
"4989","NUK Disney Learner Cup, Winnie The Pooh, 5 Ounce","We tried many varieties of cups before landing on these NUK cups for our 10 month old daughter. They work well and don\'t spill out the top. The base with handles is removable, so the cup grows with the child. The design is nice and works for both boys and girls. I also appreciate that it is easier for my daughter to get fluid out of these than other cups we\'ve tried. She doesn\'t get frustrated and now actually prefers these to her bottle for water and milk.",5
"4990","Dr. Brown\'s BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 8 Ounce, 3 Count","This bottle works for us perfectly. I am not sure about helping to reduce tummy ache, but my baby loves this bottle. I highly reccomend to buy it.",5
"4991","Temporary Earrings by bINK\'d GLOW IN DARK Moon &amp; Glow In Dark Stars Combo","My daughter loves that these earrings look pretty, but without the pain. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because they are kind of pricy - the jar only contains 6 pairs.",4
"4992","Badger Basket Three Basket Set, Pink","Overall, I am very pleased with these baskets. The basket is white and the liner is more cream. The sizes are great. Now let\'s see how long they last before breaking. My 2yr old has already sat in the biggest one and it held her (28lbs).",4
"4993","Go Go Bag Backpack WITH Lunchbox (Butterfly)","The quality of this set is good. My little boy loved the design too. However, the backpack is too small. I bought it for him to take to preschool, but it doesn\'t fit his lunch, a spare set of clothes and any papers that the school sends home. He\'s still using the lunchbox, but we had to get another backpack for him to take to preschool.",3
"4994","Sassy Developmental Stim Gym Play Mat","This is a wonderful play mat for baby! It is durable, bright and colorful and has four fun toys that come with it and a little floor mirror too! It is very easy to put together and I like that!",5

"4996","Thirsties Duo Wrap Diaper Cover with Hook and Loop, Aqua, Size 1","Thirsties Duo Wrap Diaper Cover was made to provide a soft touch to the baby&#8217;s skin while at the same time being completely waterproof.The insides can be wiped clean after each use, making it easy to reuse and reuse again. The recommendation is to replace the cover after using with 3 to 4 diapers. Thirsties uses a hook and loop closure system that works well. Size 1 is good for 6-18 pounds and the next size should be good enough to fit until baby is potty trained and no longer needs them.This is a good product and I really don&#8217;t see any downsides. Whether hook and loop is better than snaps is a matter of personal preference. If you don&#8217;t have a strong preference, I am pretty sure you will love Thirsties Duo Wrap covers.",4
"4997","Summer Infant Deluxe PiddlePad","GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE!! Potty training can be scary but with this I felt if my daughter had an accident it would be an easier clean up. So far she spilled water on her lap and the piddlepad contained it so her seat was dry underneath. Highly recommend.",5
"4998","Belvah Quilted Floral Diaper Bag - 3 Pc - Brown/Turquoise","The look of this bag was wonderful, the quality however was not. I didn\'t see some of the reviews until after I had already ordered it, a lot of people had mentioned the zipper breaking. When I got mine, the zipper wasn\'t funcitonal either, and the quilting on the bag itself was coming undone, the threading was loose. I sent it back. I don\'t think I will purchase anything made by this company in the future.",NA
"4999","Infantino Compact 2-in-1 Shopping Cart Cover","I bought this because shopping carts and public highchairs have a tendency to be gross and there are not always wipes to clean them.  It\'s easy to use and cute. Although I don\'t like the seat belt that comes with it, it\'s not strong enough to actually secure your child if she wants to escape.",NA
"5000","The Grandparent Gift Co. Brag Books Smiles, Daddy","I wanted to give a small gift to give my niece when she became an aunt for the first time.  She was leaving a few weeks after the baby was born to study abroad and felt bad about leaving the the baby.  It was the perfect gift to fill with pictures of the baby that she could look at while she is away.",4
